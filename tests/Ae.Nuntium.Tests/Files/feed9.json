Other very distant supermassive black holes we’ve known about for decades are over 1 billion times the mass of the Sun. These two are so small that they are closer to the size of Sagittarius A\\*, the supermassive black hole at the centre of our Milky Way galaxy, which is 4.6 million times the mass of the Sun.\n \nUnmistakable signatures of the distances to their host galaxies are in each [spectrum](https://esawebb.org/about/general/spectroscopy-with-webb/) above: Three lines appear in the same order – one hydrogen line followed by two ionised oxygen lines. Where this pattern falls reveals the redshift of the two targets, showing researchers how long ago their light was emitted.\n \nThe first spectrum proves black hole CEERS 2782 existed only 1.1 billion years after the big bang, emitting its light 12.7 billion years ago. Webb’s data also show it is clear of dust. The second, CEERS 746, existed slightly earlier, 1 billion years after the big bang, but its bright accretion disk is still partially clouded by dust.\n \nThe researchers found this pair of extremely distant black holes while carefully reviewing images from the CEERS Survey – and followed up to learn their precise makeup with Webb’s microshutter array aboard NIRSpec (its [Near-Infrared Spectrograph](https://esawebb.org/about/instruments/nirspec/)), which produced the definitive spectra above. Webb was immediately able to clearly detail some of the most distant black holes yet known, which has already opened a vast new region of research.\n \nThese black holes existed toward the end of the Era of Reionization, when the universe was cast in a dense “fog.” With its [infrared observations](https://esawebb.org/wordbank/infrared-astronomy/), Webb can capture plenty of light from objects that existed during this period, which is why researchers are so excited to continue reviewing the CEERS data.\n \n*NIRSpec was built for the European Space Agency (ESA) by a consortium of European companies led by Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) with NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Centre providing its detector and micro-shutter subsystems.*\n \n[*Image description*: The graphic shows the redshift of two active supermassive black holes.

    "TextSummary": "![](https://cdn.esawebb.org/archives/images/news/CEERS3.jpg)\nResearchers have identified the most distant active supermassive black hole to date in the James Webb Space Telescope’s Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey. The black hole, within galaxy CEERS 1019, existed just over 570 million years after the big bang and weighs only 9 million solar masses. For context, the black hole at the centre of our Milky Way galaxy is 4.6 million times the mass of the Sun, and other very distant supermassive black holes we’ve known about for decades weigh more than 1 billion times the mass of the Sun. (CEERS 1019 may only hold this record for a few weeks – claims about other, more distant black holes identified by Webb are currently being carefully reviewed by the astronomical community.)\n \nThough small, CEERS 1019 is ravenous, consuming gas, dust, and stars at the highest theoretically possible rate for its size. Webb’s [spectrum](https://esawebb.org/about/general/spectroscopy-with-webb/) reflects it is fully focused on eating its “meal.”\n \nReady to explore the data? Find the white peak just past 4.7 microns. It represents hydrogen. Webb’s data are fitted to two models, because more than one source is responsible for the data’s shape. The broad model at the bottom, represented in yellow, fits faster gas swirling in the black hole’s active accretion disk. The purple model with a high peak fits slower gas in the galaxy – this is emission from stars that are actively forming.\n \nThe width of Webb’s oxygen detections, which are not shown on this chart, indicate that the stars in the surrounding galaxy have typical speeds for a massive galaxy. The team also confirmed additional detections of hydrogen, which were first found by researchers using the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes, and was also identified in data from the W. M. Keck Observatory. Webb’s data are so clear that they were able to confirm the presence of the black hole. The data can also prove that the black hole is emitting a lot of light – and that gas is speeding around the black hole.\n \nThis result is also exciting because of the additional discoveries that may soon be reported. “Detecting smaller active supermassive black holes at the early times in the universe may become a little bit more common than we expected with this telescope,” said Rebecca Larson of the University of Texas at Austin, who led this discovery.\n \nWebb’s microshutter array aboard NIRSpec (its [Near-Infrared Spectrograph](https://esawebb.org/about/instruments/nirspec/)) produced the highly detailed spectra above.\n \n*NIRSpec was built for the European Space Agency (ESA) by a consortium of European companies led by Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) with NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Centre providing its detector and micro-shutter subsystems.*\n \n[*Image description*: The graphic shows the redshift of one active supermassive black hole.

This Milky Way-sized galaxy lies about 120 million light-years away in the constellation Vela, and is a denizen of the Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster.\n \nNGC 3256 may seem peaceful, a swirl of tightly entwined spiral arms set in a hazy cloud of light, but this image shows the aftermath of an ancient cosmic clash. This distorted galaxy is the wreckage of a head-on collision between two equally massive spiral galaxies which astronomers estimate to have met around 500 million years ago. The tumultuous past of NGC 3256 is captured in the long tendrils of shining dust and stars which extend outwards from the main body of the galaxy.

The initial imagery from Webb’s NIRCam ([Near-Infrared Camera](https://esawebb.org/about/instruments/nircam-niriss/)) is already fascinating researchers.\n \nSaturn itself appears extremely dark at this infrared wavelength observed by the telescope, as methane gas absorbs almost all of the sunlight falling on the atmosphere. However, the icy rings stay relatively bright, leading to the unusual appearance of Saturn in the Webb image.\n \nThis image was taken as part of Webb Guaranteed Time Observation program 1247. The program included several very deep exposures of Saturn, which were designed to test the telescope’s capacity to detect faint moons around the planet and its bright rings. Details in the orbital characteristics of newly discovered moons could help scientists put together a more complete picture of the current system of Saturn, as well as its past.\n \nThis new image of Saturn clearly shows details within the planet’s ring system, along with several of the planet’s moons – Dione, Enceladus, and Tethys. Additional deeper exposures (not shown here) will allow the team to probe some of the planet’s fainter rings, not visible in this image, including the thin G ring and the diffuse E ring. Saturn’s rings are made up of an array of rocky and icy fragments – the particles range in size from smaller than a grain of sand to a few as large as mountains on Earth. Researchers recently used Webb to explore Enceladus, and found a large plume jetting from the southern pole of the moon that contains both particles and plentiful amounts of water vapor – this plume feeds Saturn’s E ring.\n \nSaturn’s atmosphere also shows surprising and unexpected detail. This is the first time that the planet’s atmosphere has been seen with such clarity at this particular wavelength (3.23 microns). The large, dark, diffuse structures in the northern hemisphere do not follow the planet’s lines of latitude, so this image is lacking the familiar striped appearance that is typically seen from Saturn’s deeper atmospheric layers. The patchiness is reminiscent of large-scale planetary waves in the stratospheric aerosols high above the main clouds, potentially similar to those seen in early Webb NIRCam observations of Jupiter.\n \nWhen comparing the northern and southern poles of the planet in this image, the differences in appearance are typical with known seasonal changes on Saturn. For example, Saturn is currently experiencing northern summertime, with the southern hemisphere emerging from the darkness at the end of a winter. However, the northern pole is particularly dark, perhaps due to an unknown seasonal process affecting polar aerosols in particular. A tiny hint of brightening towards the edge of Saturn’s disk might be due to high-altitude methane fluorescence (the process of emitting light after absorbing light), emission from the trihydrogen ion (H3+) in the ionosphere, or both; [spectroscopy](https://esawebb.org/about/general/spectroscopy-with-webb/) from Webb could help confirm this.\n \nMissions like NASA’s Pioneer 11, Voyagers 1 and 2, the Cassini spacecraft, and the NASA/ESA [Hubble Space Telescope](http://esawebb.org/images/feed/esahubble.org) have tracked Saturn’s atmosphere and rings for many decades.

They gather together not only into clusters, but into vast interconnected filamentary structures with gigantic barren voids in between. This “cosmic web” started out tenuous and became more distinct over time as gravity drew matter together.\n \nAstronomers for the ASPIRE program using the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope have discovered a thread-like arrangement of 10 galaxies that existed just 830 million years after the Big Bang.

They accomplished this feat with a cross-disciplinary expert analysis, including key input from laboratory spectroscopists. The vital role of CH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> in interstellar carbon chemistry has been predicted since the 1970s, but Webb’s unique capabilities have finally made observing it possible — in a region of space where planets capable of accommodating life could eventually form.\n \nThis graphic shows the area, in the centre of the Orion Nebula, that was studied by the team. The nebula lies about 1350 light-years from Earth. The largest image, on the left, is from Webb’s [NIRCam](https://esawebb.org/about/instruments/nircam-niriss/) instrument. On the right, the telescope is focused on a smaller area, where the team have used Webb’s [MIRI](https://esawebb.org/about/instruments/miri/) instrument to add more depth to their study. A total of eighteen filters across both the MIRI and NIRCam instruments were used in these images, covering a range of wavelengths from 1.4 microns in the near-infrared to 25.5 microns in the mid-infrared. The detailed coverage was necessary for the team to study the light from protoplanetary discs, and analyse the unique features revealed by Webb using [spectroscopy](https://esawebb.org/wordbank/spectrograph-spectroscopy/) from its MIRI and NIRSpec instruments.\n \nThe region captured here in breathtaking detail by Webb is a part of the Orion Nebula known as the Orion Bar. It is an ionisation front, where energetic far-ultraviolet light from the Trapezium Cluster — located off the upper-left corner — interacts with dense molecular clouds. The energy of the stellar radiation is slowly eroding the Orion Bar, and this has a profound effect on the molecules and chemistry in the protoplanetary discs that have formed around newborn stars here.\n \nAt the very centre of the MIRI area is an ionised star-protoplanetary disc system, or proplyd, named d203-506. The pullout at the bottom right displays a combined NIRCam and MIRI image of this young system. Its extended shape is due to pressure from the harsh ultraviolet radiation striking it.

The brightest star here, θ² Orionis A, is surrounded by particularly bright and red puffs of dust, which are reflecting the star’s light towards Earth. Its great brightness — it is visible with the naked eye — is due to the fact that θ² Orionis A is itself a ternary system made of three closely bound bright stars.\n \nThere are more proplyds visible in this image than just d203-506 — the Orion Nebula is replete with such new stars.

The vital role of CH3+ in interstellar carbon chemistry has been predicted since the 1970s, but Webb’s unique capabilities have finally made observing it possible — in a region of space where planets capable of accommodating life could eventually form.\n \nThis hazy image is Webb’s view of a small region of the Orion Nebula, made with its [MIRI](https://esawebb.org/about/instruments/miri/) instrument. Filled with gas and dust, the Orion Nebula is a rich star-forming region. The newborn and young stars emit harsh ultraviolet radiation that ionises the nebula, causing it to emit light at infrared wavelengths. MIRI is sensitive to long-wavelength, mid-infrared emission, highlighting the layers of hot gases on each side of the Orion Bar that stretches through the centre. The area captured here by MIRI is much smaller than the NIRCam view, but contains a remarkable amount of detail, thanks to MIRI’s unprecedented sensitivity at these longer wavelengths.\n \nThis zoomed-in MIRI view of the Orion Bar contains the young star-protoplanetary disc system, named d203-506, that the team of astronomers scoured for key organic molecules. MIRI’s contribution to the view of d203-506 was critical to obtaining the widest range of spectra of the system, necessary to confirm their detection of the methyl cation. In particular, the molecule has a strong spectral line at around 7 microns, a wavelength that is impossible to detect through Earth’s atmosphere, but with MIRI’s in-built spectroscopy the team was able to unambiguously confirm the methyl cation’s presence.\n \nThis version of the MIRI image has been scaled up, to match the scale of the larger NIRCam image. You can find the image in its original scale [here](https://esawebb.org/images/weic2315a/).\n \n[*Image description*: A nebula made of many layers of cloudy, colourful material.

The area captured here by MIRI is much smaller than the NIRCam view, but contains a remarkable amount of detail, thanks to MIRI’s unprecedented sensitivity at these longer wavelengths.</p>\n<p>This zoomed-in MIRI view of the Orion Bar contains the young star-protoplanetary disc system, named d203-506, that the team of astronomers scoured for key organic molecules. MIRI’s contribution to the view of d203-506 was critical to obtaining the widest range of spectra of the system, necessary to confirm their detection of the methyl cation. In particular, the molecule has a strong spectral line at around 7 microns, a wavelength that is impossible to detect through Earth’s atmosphere, but with MIRI’s in-built spectroscopy the team was able to unambiguously confirm the methyl cation’s presence.</p>\n<p>This version of the MIRI image has been scaled up, to match the scale of the larger NIRCam image. You can find the image in its original scale <a href=\"https://esawebb.org/images/weic2315a/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>[<em>Image description</em>: A nebula made of many layers of cloudy, colourful material. In the top-left the nebula is coloured in greens, reds and yellows with a webbed, filament structure, two small stars and a darker gap region. A wall of thick, cloudy material crosses diagonally, extending towards the bottom right. It gives way to dark blue, sparse filaments with more dark gaps in the bottom corner. The image is hazy and unfocused.]</p>",

    "TextSummary": "![](https://cdn.esawebb.org/archives/images/news/trappist1c-1.jpg)\nInfrared measurements by the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope of TRAPPIST-1 c indicate that it is probably not as Venus-like as once imagined. Webb has successfully measured the heat radiating from TRAPPIST-1 c, an exoplanet orbiting a red dwarf star 40 light-years from Earth. With a dayside temperature of about 107 degrees Celsius, it is the coolest rocky planet ever characterised using this method.\n \nThis light curve shows the change in brightness of the TRAPPIST-1 system as the second planet, TRAPPIST-1 c, moves behind the star. This phenomenon is known as a secondary eclipse.\n \nAstronomers used Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument ([MIRI](https://esawebb.org/about/instruments/miri/)) to measure the brightness of mid-infrared light. When the planet is beside the star, the light emitted by both the star and the dayside of the planet reach the telescope, and the system appears brighter. When the planet is behind the star, the light emitted by the planet is blocked and only the starlight reaches the telescope, causing the apparent brightness to decrease.\n \nAstronomers can subtract the brightness of the star from the combined brightness of the star and planet to calculate how much infrared light is coming from the planet’s dayside. This is then used to calculate the dayside temperature and infer the presence and possible composition of the atmosphere.\n \nThe graph shows combined data from four separate observations made using MIRI’s F1500W filter, which only allows light with wavelengths ranging from about 13.5 - 16.7 microns to pass through to the detectors. The blue squares are individual brightness measurements. The red circles show measurements that are “binned,” or averaged to make it easier to see the change over time. The white line is the best fit, or model light curve that matches the data most closely. The decrease in brightness during the secondary eclipse is less than 0.05%.\n \nThe temperature calculated from this observation is 380 +/- 31 kelvins (between 76 and 138 degrees Celsius). TRAPPIST-1 c is the coolest rocky exoplanet ever observed using secondary eclipse photometry.\n \nThis research was conducted as part of Webb’s [General Observers](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-programs/general-observers) (GO) program [2304](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/phase2-public/2304.pdf), which is one of eight programs from Webb’s first year of science designed to help fully characterise the TRAPPIST-1 system. This coming year, researchers will conduct a [follow-up investigation](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/phase2-public/3077.pdf) to observe the full orbits of TRAPPIST-1 b and TRAPPIST-1 c. This will make it possible to see how the temperatures change from the day to the night sides of the two planets and will provide further constraints on whether they have atmospheres or not.\n \n[Image description: Graphic titled “Rocky Exoplanet TRAPPIST-1 c Secondary Eclipse Light Curve” showing a diagram of a secondary eclipse and a graph of change in brightness over time.]",
