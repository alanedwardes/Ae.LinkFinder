&lt;img src="https://cdn.spacetelescope.org/archives/images/news/potw2328a.jpg" border="0" align="left" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has captured a monster in the making in this observation of the exceptional &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/galaxy/"&gt;galaxy&lt;/a&gt; cluster eMACS J1353.7+4329, which lies about eight billion light-years from Earth in the constellation Canes Venatici. This disturbed collection of at least two galaxy clusters is in the process of merging together to create a cosmic monster, a single gargantuan cluster acting as a gravitational lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/gravitational-lensing/"&gt;Gravitational lensing&lt;/a&gt; is a dramatic example of Einstein’s general theory of relativity in action. A celestial body such as a galaxy cluster is sufficiently massive to distort spacetime, which causes the path of light around the object to be visibly bent as if by a vast lens. Gravitational lensing can also magnify distant objects, allowing astronomers to observe objects that would otherwise be too faint and too far away to be detected. It can also distort the images of background galaxies, turning them into streaks of light. The first hints of gravitational lensing are already visible in this image as bright arcs which mingle with the throng of galaxies in eMACS J1353.7+4329.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data in this image are drawn from an observing proposal called Monsters in the Making, which used two of Hubble’s instruments to observe five exceptional galaxy clusters at multiple &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/electromagnetic-spectrum/"&gt;wavelengths&lt;/a&gt;. These multi-wavelength observations were made possible by Hubble’s &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/about/general/instruments/wfc3/"&gt;Wide Field Camera 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/about/general/instruments/acs/"&gt;Advanced Camera for Surveys&lt;/a&gt;. The astronomers behind these observations hope to lay the groundwork for future studies of vast gravitational lenses with next-generation telescopes such as the NASA/ESA/CSA &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/james-webb-space-telescope/"&gt;James Webb Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Image Description:&lt;/em&gt; A cluster of elliptical galaxies, visible as a dense crowd of oval shapes, each glowing orange around a bright core. Right of the largest, central galaxy, a background galaxy is stretched into two connected, thin arcs by the cluster’s gravity. Various other galaxies are dotted all around, a few being small spirals. A bright star with four long spikes stands out at the right.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.spacetelescope.org/archives/images/news/potw2327a.jpg" border="0" align="left" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spiral &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/galaxy/"&gt;galaxy&lt;/a&gt; UGC 11860 seems to float serenely against a field of background galaxies in this image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. UGC 11860 lies around 184 million light-years away in the constellation Pegasus, and its untroubled appearance is deceiving; this galaxy recently played host to an almost unimaginably energetic stellar explosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/supernova/"&gt;supernova&lt;/a&gt; explosion — the catastrophically violent end of a massive &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/star/"&gt;star&lt;/a&gt;’s life — was &lt;a href="https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=6301"&gt;detected in UGC 11860 in 2014 by a robotic telescope&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to scouring the skies for transient astronomical phenomena &lt;span style="color: #444746; font-family: 'Google Sans', Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: italic; letter-spacing: 0.2px; white-space-collapse: preserve-breaks;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; astronomical objects that are only visible for a short period of time. Two different teams of astronomers used Hubble’s &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/about/general/instruments/wfc3/"&gt;Wide Field Camera 3&lt;/a&gt; to search through the aftermath and unpick the lingering remnants of this vast cosmic explosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One team explored UGC 11860 to understand more about the progenitor star systems that eventually meet their demise in supernovae. The hugely energetic processes during supernova explosions are predominantly responsible for forging the elements between silicon and nickel on the periodic table. This means that understanding the influence of the masses and compositions of the progenitor star systems is vital to explaining how many of the chemical elements here on Earth originated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other group of astronomers used Hubble to follow up supernovae that were detected by robotic telescopes. These automated eyes on the sky function without human intervention, and capture transient events in the night sky. Robotic telescopes allow astronomers to detect everything from unexpected asteroids to rare, unpredictable supernovae, and can identify intriguing objects that can then be investigated in more detail by powerful telescopes such as Hubble.&lt;/p&gt;

The centre glows in warm colours, and has two prominent spiral arms around it, with bright points of star formation. The galaxy appears centrally in a field of small stars and galaxies on a dark background.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.spacetelescope.org/archives/images/news/potw2326a.jpg" border="0" align="left" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highly irregular &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/galaxy/"&gt;galaxy&lt;/a&gt; ESO 174-1, which resembles a lonely, hazy cloud against a backdrop of bright &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/star/"&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt;, dominates this image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. ESO 174-1 lies around 11 million light-years from Earth and consists of a bright cloud of stars and a faint, meandering tendril of dark gas and dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image is part of a collection of Hubble observations that aims to get to know our nearby galactic neighbours. To be more precise, the observations aim to resolve the brightest stars and basic properties of every known galaxy within 10 megaparsecs. A parsec is a unit used by astronomers to measure the vast distances to other galaxies — 10 megaparsecs translates to 32 million light-years — and makes astronomical distances easier to handle. For example, the nearest star to the Sun, Proxima Centauri, is about 1.3 parsecs away. In everyday units this is a staggering 40 million million kilometres! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The programme to capture all of our neighbouring galaxies was designed to use the 2-3% of Hubble time that absolutely no other observing programme can use. Many of the myriad objects that Hubble observes can only be seen at certain times of year, which makes filling out the observatory’s schedule a daunting logistical challenge. Observing programmes such as the one which captured ESO 174-1 help Hubble’s operators get the most out of every last minute of observing time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Image Description:&lt;/em&gt; A galaxy, large and occupying most of the view from the centre. The whole galaxy is made of smooth, diffuse light. In the centre it is brighter and bluer, fading to a pale grey halo that is faint and see-through. The light forms an arm on one side that curls around the top. A couple threads of dark dust cross the centre. Many stars shine around the galaxy, on a black background.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.spacetelescope.org/archives/images/news/potw2325a.jpg" border="0" align="left" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teeming stars of the &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/globular-cluster/"&gt;globular cluster&lt;/a&gt; NGC 6544 glisten in this image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. This cluster of tightly bound stars lies more than 8000 light-years away from Earth and is — like all globular clusters — a densely populated region of tens of thousands of stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image of NGC 6544 combines data from two of Hubble’s instruments — the &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/about/general/instruments/acs/"&gt;Advanced Camera for Surveys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/about/general/instruments/wfc3/"&gt;Wide Field Camera 3&lt;/a&gt; — as well as two separate astronomical observations. The first observation was designed to find a visible counterpart to the radio pulsar discovered in NGC 6544. A pulsar is the rapidly spinning remnant of a &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/neutron-star/"&gt;dead star&lt;/a&gt;, emitting twin beams of electromagnetic radiation like a vast astronomical lighthouse. This pulsar rotates particularly quickly, and astronomers turned to Hubble to help determine how this object evolved in NGC 6544. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second observation which contributed data to this image was also designed to find the visible counterparts of objects detected at other &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/electromagnetic-spectrum/"&gt;electromagnetic wavelengths&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of matching up sources to a pulsar, however, astronomers used Hubble to search for the counterparts of faint X-ray sources. Their observations could help explain how clusters like NGC 6544 change over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NGC 6544 lies in the constellation Sagittarius, close to the vast Lagoon Nebula, a hazy &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/nebula/"&gt;labyrinth of gas and dust&lt;/a&gt; sculpted by the fierce winds of newly born stars. The Lagoon Nebula is truly colossal — even by astronomical standards — and measures 55 light-years across and 20 light-years from top to bottom. &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/news/heic1808/"&gt;Previous Hubble images&lt;/a&gt; of the nebula incorporated &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/infrared-astronomy/"&gt;infrared&lt;/a&gt; observations to reveal young stars and intricate structures that would be obscured at visible wavelengths by clouds of gas and dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Image Description:&lt;/em&gt; A cluster of stars in warm and cool colours. The whole view is filled with small stars, which become much denser and brighter around a core just right of centre. Most of the stars are small, but some are larger with a round, brightly-coloured glow and four sharp diffraction spikes. Behind the stars, a dark background can be seen.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.spacetelescope.org/archives/images/news/potw2324a.jpg" border="0" align="left" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/galaxy/"&gt;galaxy&lt;/a&gt; NGC 7292 billows across this image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, accompanied by a handful of bright &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/star/"&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt; and the indistinct smudges of extremely distant galaxies in the background. It lies around 44 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Pegasus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This slightly dishevelled galaxy is irregular, meaning that it lacks the distinct &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/spiral-galaxy/"&gt;spiral arms&lt;/a&gt; of galaxies like the &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/images/heic0506a/"&gt;Whirlpool Galaxy&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/elliptical-galaxy/"&gt;smooth elliptical shape&lt;/a&gt; of galaxies like &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/images/potw1921a/"&gt;Messier 59&lt;/a&gt;. Unusually, its core is stretched out into a distinct bar, a feature seen in many spiral galaxies. Alongside its hazy shape, NGC 7292 is remarkably faint. As a result, astronomers classify NGC 7292 as a low surface brightness galaxy, barely distinguishable against the backdrop of the night sky. Such galaxies are typically dominated by gas and dark matter rather than stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronomers directed Hubble to inspect NGC 7292 during an observational campaign studying the aftermath of Type II &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/supernova/"&gt;supernovae&lt;/a&gt;. These colossal explosions happen when a massive star collapses and then violently rebounds in a catastrophic explosion that tears the star apart. Astronomers hope to learn more about the diversity of Type II supernovae they have observed by scrutinising the aftermath and remaining nearby stars of a large sample of historical Type II supernovae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NGC 7292’s supernova was observed in 1964 and accordingly given the identifier SN 1964H. Studying the stellar neighbourhood of SN 1964H helps astronomers estimate the initial mass of the star that went supernova, and could uncover surviving stellar companions that once shared a system with the star that would become SN 1964H.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Image Description:&lt;/em&gt; A galaxy fills up most of the frame from the right. It is fuzzy and diffuse, but made up of numerous tiny stars. In the core, the stars merge into a glowing bar shape. The gas and stars in the galaxy vary between warm and cool colours. They are spread over a large area, the colours mixing like clouds. The glow of the galaxy fades into a black background, with a few stars and small, distant galaxies.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.spacetelescope.org/archives/images/news/potw2323a.jpg" border="0" align="left" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jellyfish &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/galaxy/"&gt;galaxy&lt;/a&gt; JO206 trails across this image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, showcasing a colourful &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/star/"&gt;star&lt;/a&gt;-forming disc surrounded by a pale, luminous cloud of dust. A handful of bright stars with criss-cross diffraction spikes stand out against an inky black backdrop at the bottom of the image. JO206 lies over 700 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Aquarius, and this image of the galaxy is the sixth and final instalment in a series of observations of jellyfish galaxies. Some of Hubble's other observations of these peculiar galaxies — which range from &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/images/potw2321a/"&gt;grandiose&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/images/potw2318a/"&gt;ghostly&lt;/a&gt; — are available &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/images/?search=Jellyfish+galaxies"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jellyfish galaxies are so-called because of their resemblance to their aquatic namesakes. In this image, the disc of JO206 is trailed by long tendrils of bright star formation that stretch towards the bottom right of this image, just as jellyfish trail tentacles behind them. The tendrils of jellyfish galaxies are formed by the interaction between galaxies and the intra-cluster medium, a tenuous superheated plasma that pervades galaxy clusters. As galaxies move through galaxy clusters they ram into the intracluster medium, which strips gas from the galaxies and draws it into the long tendrils of star formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tentacles of jellyfish galaxies give astronomers a unique opportunity to study star formation under extreme conditions, far from the influence of the main disc of the galaxy. Surprisingly, Hubble revealed that there are no striking differences between star formation in the discs of jellyfish galaxies and star formation in their tentacles, which suggests the environment of newly-formed stars has only a minor influence on their formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Image Description:&lt;/em&gt; A spiral galaxy that is tilted partially toward us. Its inner disc is bright and colourful, with bluish and reddish spots of star formation throughout the arms. An outer disc of pale, dim dust surrounds it. It has many arms, which are being pulled away from the disc, down and to the right. They stretch into long, faint trails that cross the image. The background is dark and mostly empty, with three bright stars.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.spacetelescope.org/archives/images/news/potw2322a.jpg" border="0" align="left" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/spiral-galaxy/"&gt;spiral galaxy&lt;/a&gt; NGC 298 basks in this image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. NGC 298 lies around 89 million light-years away in the constellation Cetus, and appears isolated in this image — only a handful of distant galaxies and foreground stars accompany the lonely galaxy. While NGC 298 seems peaceful, in 1986 it was host to one of astronomy's most extreme events: a catastrophic stellar explosion known as a Type II &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/supernova/"&gt;supernova&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hubble’s &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/about/general/instruments/acs/"&gt;Advanced Camera for Surveys&lt;/a&gt; captured NGC 298 as part of an investigation into the origins of Type II supernovae. All Type II supernovae are produced by the collapse and subsequent explosion of young, massive stars, but they can produce a spectacular diversity of brightnesses and &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/spectrograph-spectroscopy/"&gt;spectral&lt;/a&gt; features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronomers suspect that the diversity of this cosmic firework show might be due to &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/stellar-wind/"&gt;gas and dust being stripped from the stars&lt;/a&gt; that will eventually produce Type II supernovae. Observing the region surrounding supernova explosions can reveal traces of the progenitor star’s history preserved in this lost mass, as well as revealing any companion stars that survived the supernova. Hubble used the brief periods between scheduled observations to explore the aftermath of a number of Type II supernovae, hoping to piece together the relationship between Type II supernovae and the stellar systems which give rise to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Image description: A spiral galaxy. It is tilted diagonally, and slightly towards the viewer, making its core and disc separately visible.

&lt;img src="https://cdn.spacetelescope.org/archives/images/news/potw2321a.jpg" border="0" align="left" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jellyfish galaxy JW39 hangs serenely in this image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. This galaxy lies over 900 million light-years away in the constellation Coma Berenices, and is one of &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/images/?search=Jellyfish+galaxies"&gt;several jellyfish galaxies&lt;/a&gt; that Hubble has been studying over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this jellyfish galaxy’s serene appearance, it is adrift in a ferociously hostile environment; a &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/galaxy/"&gt;galaxy cluster&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to their more isolated counterparts, the galaxies in galaxy clusters are often distorted by the gravitational pull of larger neighbours, which can twist galaxies into a variety of weird and wonderful shapes. If that was not enough, the space between galaxies in a cluster is also pervaded with a searingly hot plasma known as the intracluster medium. While this plasma is extremely tenuous, galaxies moving through it experience it almost like swimmers fighting against a current, and this interaction can strip galaxies of their star-forming gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This interaction between the intracluster medium and the galaxies is called ram-pressure stripping, and is the process responsible for the trailing tendrils of this jellyfish galaxy. As JW39 has moved through the cluster the pressure of the intracluster medium has stripped away gas and dust into long trailing ribbons of star formation that now stretch away from the disc of the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronomers using Hubble’s &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/about/general/instruments/wfc3/"&gt;Wide Field Camera 3&lt;/a&gt; studied these trailing tendrils in detail, as they are a particularly extreme environment for star formation. Surprisingly, they found that star formation in the ‘tentacles’ of jellyfish galaxies was not noticeably different from star formation in the galaxy disc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Image Description:&lt;/em&gt; A spiral galaxy. It is large in the centre with a lot of detail visible. The core glows brightly and is surrounded by concentric rings of dark and light dust. The spiral arms are thick and puffy with grey dust and glowing blue areas of star formation. They wrap around the galaxy to form a ring. Part of the arm is drawn out into a dark thread above the galaxy, and dust from the arm trails off to the right.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.spacetelescope.org/archives/images/news/potw2320a.jpg" border="0" align="left" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The densely packed &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/globular-cluster/"&gt;globular cluster&lt;/a&gt; NGC 6325 glistens in this image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. This concentrated group of stars lies around 26 000 light years from Earth in the constellation Ophiuchus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globular clusters like NGC 6325 are tightly bound collections of &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/star/"&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt; with anywhere from tens of thousands to millions of members. They can be found in all types of &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/galaxy/"&gt;galaxies&lt;/a&gt;, and act as natural laboratories for astronomers studying star formation. This is because the constituent stars of globular clusters tend to form at roughly the same time and with similar initial composition, meaning that astronomers can use them to fine-tune their theories of how stars evolve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronomers inspected this particular cluster not to understand star formation, but to search for a hidden monster. Though it might look peaceful, astronomers suspect this cluster could contain an intermediate-mass &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/black-hole/"&gt;black hole&lt;/a&gt; that is subtly affecting the motion of surrounding stars. Previous research found that the distribution of stars in some highly concentrated globular clusters — those with stars packed relatively tightly together — was slightly different from what astronomers expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discrepancy suggested that at least some of these densely packed globular clusters — including perhaps NGC 6325 — could have a black hole lurking at the centre. To explore this hypothesis further, astronomers turned to Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3 to observe a larger sample of densely populated globular clusters, which included this star-studded image of NGC 6325. Additional data from Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys were also incorporated into this image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Image Description:&lt;/em&gt; A dense cluster of bright stars. The core of the cluster is to the left and has a distinct group of blue stars. Surrounding the core are a multitude of stars in warmer colours. These stars are very numerous near the core and become more and more sparse, and more small and distant, out to the sides of the image. A few larger stars also stand in the foreground near the edges of the image.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.spacetelescope.org/archives/images/news/potw2319a.jpg" border="0" align="left" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vast &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/galaxy/"&gt;galaxy&lt;/a&gt; cluster lurks in the centre of this image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. Like a submerged sea monster causing waves on the surface, this cosmic leviathan can be identified by the distortions in spacetime around it. The mass of the cluster has caused the images of background galaxies to be &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/gravitational-lensing/"&gt;gravitationally lensed&lt;/a&gt;; the galaxy cluster has caused a sufficient curvature of spacetime to bend the path of light and cause background galaxies to appear distorted into streaks and arcs of light. A host of other galaxies can be seen surrounding the cluster, and a handful of foreground stars with tell-tale diffraction spikes are scattered throughout the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular galaxy cluster is called eMACS J1823.1+7822, and lies almost nine billion light-years away in the constellation Draco. It is one of five exceptionally massive galaxy clusters explored by Hubble in the hopes of measuring the strengths of these gravitational lenses and providing insights into the distribution of dark matter in galaxy clusters. Strong gravitational lenses like eMACS J1823.1+7822 can help astronomers study distant galaxies by acting as vast natural telescopes which magnify objects that would otherwise be too faint or distant to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multiwavelength image layers data from eight different filters and two different instruments: Hubble’s &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/about/general/instruments/acs/"&gt;Advanced Camera for Surveys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/about/general/instruments/wfc3/"&gt;Wide Field Camera 3&lt;/a&gt;. Both instruments have the ability to view astronomical objects in just a small slice of the &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/electromagnetic-spectrum/"&gt;electromagnetic spectrum&lt;/a&gt; using filters, which allow astronomers to image objects at precisely selected wavelengths. The combination of observations at different wavelengths lets astronomers develop a more complete picture of the structure, composition and behaviour of an object than visible light alone would reveal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Image description:&lt;/em&gt; A cluster of large galaxies, surrounded by various stars and smaller galaxies on a dark background. The central cluster is mostly made of bright elliptical galaxies that are surrounded by a warm glow. Close to the cluster core is the stretched, distorted arc of a galaxy, gravitationally lensed by the cluster.]&lt;/p&gt;

The discs are tilted face-on as seen from Earth and so give astronomers a bird’s-eye view of what’s happening around the star. The left image, taken in 2016, shows just one shadow [A] at the 11 o’clock position. This shadow is cast by an inner disc that is slightly inclined to the outer disc and so blocks starlight. The picture on the left shows a second shadow that emerged from yet another nested disc at the 7 o’clock position, as photographed in 2021. What was originally the inner disc is marked [B] in this later view. The shadows rotate around the star at different rates like the hand on a clock. They are evidence for two unseen planets that have pulled dust into their orbits. This makes them slightly inclined to each other. This is a visible-light photo taken with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. Artificial colour has been added to enhance details.&lt;/p&gt;

Hubble photos show shadows sweeping across the discs encircling the system. The interpretation is that these shadows are from slightly inclined inner discs that block starlight from reaching the outer disc, and therefore cast a shadow. The discs are slightly inclined to each other because of the gravitational pull of unseen planets warping the disc structure.&lt;/p&gt;

We have an oblique view of three concentric rings of dust and gas. At the centre is the bright white glow of the central star. The reddish-coloured rings are inclined to each other and are therefore casting dark shadows across the outermost ring.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.spacetelescope.org/archives/images/news/sci23002a.jpg" border="0" align="left" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crowded field of galaxies throngs this ESA/Webb &lt;a href="https://esawebb.org/images/potm/"&gt;Picture of the Month&lt;/a&gt; from the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope, along with bright stars crowned with Webb’s signature six-pointed diffraction spikes. The large spiral galaxy at the base of this image is accompanied by a profusion of smaller, more distant galaxies which range from fully-fledged spirals to mere bright smudges. Named LEDA 2046648, it is situated a little over a billion light-years from Earth, in the constellation Hercules. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of Webb’s principle science goals is to observe distant galaxies in the early universe to understand the details of their formation, evolution, and composition. Webb’s keen infrared vision helps the telescope peer back in time, as the light from these distant galaxies is redshifted towards infrared wavelengths. Comparing these systems with galaxies in the local Universe will help astronomers understand how galaxies grew to form the structure we see today. Webb will also probe the chemical composition of thousands of galaxies to shed light on how heavy elements were formed and built up as galaxies evolved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To take full advantage of Webb’s potential for galaxy archeology, astronomers and engineers must first calibrate the telescope’s instruments and systems. Each of Webb’s instruments contains a labyrinthine array of mirrors and other optical elements that redirect and focus starlight gathered by Webb’s main mirror. This particular observation was part of the commissioning campaign for Webb’s Near-InfraRed Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS). As well as performing science in its own right, NIRISS supports parallel observations with Webb’s Near-InfraRed Camera (NIRCam). NIRCam captured this galaxy-studded image while NIRISS was observing the white dwarf WD1657+343, a well-studied star. This allows astronomers to interpret and compare data from the two different instruments, and to characterise the performance of NIRISS. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[I&lt;em&gt;mage description&lt;/em&gt;: Many stars and galaxies lie on a dark background, in a variety of colours but mostly shades of orange. Some galaxies are large enough to make out spiral arms. Along the bottom of the frame is a large, detailed spiral galaxy seen at an oblique angle, with another galaxy about one-quarter the size just beneath it. Both have a brightly glowing core, and areas of star formation which light up their spiral arms.] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.spacetelescope.org/archives/images/news/potw2318a.jpg" border="0" align="left" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jellyfish &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/galaxy/"&gt;galaxy&lt;/a&gt; JO175 appears to hang suspended in this image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. This galaxy lies over 650 million light-years from Earth in the appropriately-named constellation Telescopium, and was captured in crystal-clear detail by Hubble’s &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/about/general/instruments/wfc3/"&gt;Wide Field Camera 3.&lt;/a&gt; A handful of more distant galaxies are lurking throughout the scene, and a bright four-pointed &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/star/"&gt;star&lt;/a&gt; lies to the lower right side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jellyfish galaxies get their unusual name from the tendrils of star-forming gas and dust that trail behind them, just like the tentacles of a jellyfish. These bright tendrils contain clumps of star formation and give jellyfish galaxies a particularly striking appearance. Unlike their ocean-dwelling namesakes, jellyfish galaxies make their homes in galaxy clusters, and the pressure of the tenuous superheated plasma that permeates these galaxy clusters is what draws out the jellyfish galaxies’ distinctive tendrils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hubble recently completed a deep dive into jellyfish clusters, specifically the star-forming clumps of gas and dust that stud their tendrils. By studying the origins and fate of the stars in these clumps, astronomers hoped to better understand the processes underpinning star formation elsewhere in the Universe. Interestingly, their research suggests that star formation in the discs of galaxies is similar to star formation in the extreme conditions found in the tendrils of jellyfish galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Image Description:&lt;/em&gt; A spiral galaxy. Its spiral arms are studded with many pink spots, especially around the top of the galaxy. One arm is sticking out below the galaxy. From it and around the bottom of the galaxy, faint gas streams away, while little gas is visible above the galaxy. The galaxy is quite small in the centre of a dark background, where a few smaller galaxies of various shapes and sizes hang.]&lt;/p&gt;

The cold, wispy cloud material (blue, centre) is illuminated in the infrared by the glow of the young, outflowing protostar Ced 110 IRS 4 (orange, upper left). The light from numerous background stars, seen as orange dots behind the cloud, can be used to detect ices in the cloud, which absorb the starlight passing through them.  An international team of astronomers has reported the discovery of diverse ices in the darkest, coldest regions of a molecular cloud measured to date by studying this region. This result allows astronomers to examine the simple icy molecules that will be incorporated into future exoplanets, while opening a new window on the origin of more complex molecules that are the first step in the creation of the building blocks of life. [Image Description: A large, dark cloud is contained within the frame. In its top half it is textured like smoke and has wispy gaps, while at the bottom and at the sides it fades gradually out of view. On the left are several orange stars: three each with six large spikes, and one behind the cloud which colours it pale blue and orange. Many tiny stars are visible, and the background is black.]&lt;/p&gt;

As well as several large &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/elliptical-galaxy/"&gt;elliptical&lt;/a&gt; galaxies, a ring-shaped galaxy is lurking on the right of this image. A pair of bright &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/star/"&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt; are also visible at the left of this image, notable for their colourful criss-crossing diffraction spikes. This collection of astronomical curiosities is the &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/galaxy/"&gt;galaxy&lt;/a&gt; cluster ACO S520 in the constellation Pictor, which was captured by Hubble’s &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/about/general/instruments/acs/"&gt;Advanced Camera for Surveys&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of a series of Hubble observations searching for massive, luminous galaxy clusters that had not been captured by earlier surveys. Appropriately, the proposal for observing time was named "They almost got away"! Astronomers took advantage of occasional gaps in Hubble's busy schedule to capture images of these barely-explored galaxy clusters, revealing a wealth of interesting targets for further study with Hubble and the NASA/ESA/CSA &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/james-webb-space-telescope/"&gt;James Webb Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galaxy clusters are among the largest known objects in the Universe, and studying these objects can provide insights into the distribution of &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/dark-matter/"&gt;dark matter&lt;/a&gt;, which is responsible for most of the mass of a galaxy cluster. The vast masses of galaxy clusters is what causes many of them to act as &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/gravitational-lensing/"&gt;gravitational lenses&lt;/a&gt; which distort and magnify light from even more distant objects. This can allow astronomers to use galaxy clusters as a kind of natural gravitational telescope to reveal distant objects that would usually be too faint to resolve — even for the crystal-clear vision of Hubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.spacetelescope.org/archives/images/news/heic2304b.jpg" border="0" align="left" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astronomers are celebrating the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope’s 33rd launch anniversary with an ethereal photo of a nearby star-forming region, NGC 1333. The nebula is in the Perseus molecular cloud, and is located approximately 960 light-years away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hubble’s colourful view, showcasing its unique capability to obtain images in light from ultraviolet to near-infrared, unveils an effervescent cauldron of glowing gases and pitch-black dust stirred up and blown around by several hundred newly forming stars embedded within the dark cloud. Even then, Hubble just scratches the surface; most of the star-birthing firestorm is hidden behind clouds of fine dust — essentially soot — that are thicker toward the bottom of the image. The black areas of the image are not empty space, but are filled with obscuring dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To capture this image, Hubble peered through a veil of dust on the edge of a giant cloud of cold molecular hydrogen — the raw material for fabricating new stars and planets under the relentless pull of gravity. The image underscores the fact that star formation is a messy process in a rambunctious Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferocious stellar winds, likely from the bright blue star at the top of the image, are blowing through a curtain of dust. The fine dust scatters the starlight at blue wavelengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farther down, another bright super-hot star shines through filaments of obscuring dust, looking like the Sun shining through scattered clouds. A diagonal string of fainter accompanying stars looks reddish because the dust is filtering their starlight, allowing more of the red light to get through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom of the picture presents a keyhole peek deep into the dark nebula. Hubble captures the reddish glow of ionised hydrogen. It looks like the finale of a fireworks display, with several overlapping events. This is caused by pencil-thin jets shooting out from newly forming stars outside the frame of view. These stars are surrounded by circumstellar discs, which may eventually produce planetary systems, and powerful magnetic fields that direct two parallel beams of hot gas deep into space, like a double lightsaber from science fiction films. They sculpt patterns on the hydrogen cocoon, like laser lightshow tracings. The jets are a star’s birth announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view offers an example of the time when our own Sun and planets formed inside such a dusty molecular cloud, 4.6 billion years ago. Our Sun didn’t form in isolation but was instead embedded inside a mosh pit of frantic stellar birth, perhaps even more energetic and massive than NGC 1333.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Image description&lt;/em&gt;: The left half is a color image of NGC 1333 labeled “NGC 1333, HST WFC3/UVIS”. Four filter labels are in blue (F475W), green (F606W), and red (F657N H-alpha plus N-two, and F814W). At bottom a scale bar is labeled 0.2 light-years and 43 arcseconds. The right half shows four black-and-white panels in a two-by-two layout. Each panel is a view of NGC 1333 in an individual filter. ]&lt;/p&gt;

The spectacular galaxy lies around 260 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Pisces and is almost face on, allowing its lazily winding spiral arms to stretch across this image. In the foreground, a smaller edge-on &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/galaxy/"&gt;galaxy&lt;/a&gt; seems to bisect the upper portion of UGC 678.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like humans, stars have a natural lifecycle; they are born, grow up, and eventually grow old and die. Studying this stellar life cycle — usually referred to as stellar evolution — is an important topic for astronomers. The ends of star lives can be marked by truly spectacular events, including titanic &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/supernova/"&gt;supernova&lt;/a&gt; explosions, the creation of unimaginably dense &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/neutron-star/"&gt;neutron stars&lt;/a&gt;, and even the birth of &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/black-hole/"&gt;black holes&lt;/a&gt;. UGC 678 was recently found to be host to one of these events; in 2020 a robotic telescope scanning the night sky in search of dangerous asteroids discovered evidence of an enormous supernova explosion in the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two separate Hubble observations turned to UGC 678 to scour the galaxy in search of the aftermath of its supernova explosion. One team of astronomers used Hubble’s &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/about/general/instruments/acs/"&gt;Advanced Camera for Surveys&lt;/a&gt;, and the other the &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/about/general/instruments/wfc3/"&gt;Wide Field Camera 3&lt;/a&gt;, but both aimed to explore UGC 678 in the hope of unearthing clues to the identity of the star that produced the 2020 supernova.&lt;/p&gt;

Because the galaxy is too far away for astronomers to employ stereoscopic vision, they instead followed the motion of stars around the center of M87, like bees around a hive. This created a three-dimensional view of how stars are distributed within the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronomers picked one of the nearest ellipticals to Earth, M87, located 54 million light-years away in the heart of the vast Virgo cluster of galaxies. By following the motion of stars around the center of M87, like bees around a hive, they’ve measured that the galaxy is potato-shaped. It not only has a long and short axis, which defines an ellipse on a piece of graph paper, but they measured a third axis which helps define the three-dimensionality. The geometric term is: triaxial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.spacetelescope.org/archives/images/news/potw2315a.jpg" border="0" align="left" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we see JO204, a ‘jellyfish &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/galaxy/"&gt;galaxy&lt;/a&gt;’ so named for the bright tendrils of gas that appear in this image to be drifting lazily below JO204’s bright central bulk. The galaxy lies almost 600 million light-years away in the constellation Sextans. This image was captured by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, and it is the third of a series of &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/images/potw/"&gt;Pictures of the Week&lt;/a&gt; featuring jellyfish galaxies. This series of images is possible thanks to a survey in which observations were made of six of these fascinating galaxies, including JO204. This survey was performed with the intention of better understanding &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/star/"&gt;star&lt;/a&gt; formation under extreme conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the dreamy appearance of this image, it would be understandable to wonder why jellyfish galaxies should be such a crucible for star formation. The answer is that — as is often the case with astronomy — first appearances can be deceiving. Whilst the delicate ribbons of gas beneath JO204 may look like floating jellyfish tentacles, they are in fact the outcome of an intense astronomical process known as ram pressure stripping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ram pressure is a particular type of pressure exerted on a body when it moves relative to a fluid. An intuitive example is the sensation of pressure you experience when you are standing in an intense gust of wind — the wind is a moving fluid, and your body feels pressure from it. An extension of this analogy is that your body will remain whole and coherent, but the more loosely bound things — like your hair and your clothes — will flap in the wind. The same is true for jellyfish galaxies. They experience ram pressure because of their movement against the intergalactic medium that fills the spaces between galaxies in a galaxy cluster. The galaxies experience intense pressure from that movement, and as a result their more loosely bound gas is stripped away. This gas is mostly the colder and denser gas in the galaxy — gas which, when stirred and compressed by the ram pressure, collapses and forms new stars in the jellyfish’s beautiful tendrils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Image Description:&lt;/em&gt; A spiral galaxy in the centre is tilted almost edge-on. The bright core and spiral arms can just be seen from the top. A slight glow surrounds it. Below, strands made of bright blue patches trail down like tentacles. On the left it is just touched by a second, faint and dim galaxy. The background is very dark, with only a few other stars and tiny galaxies visible.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.spacetelescope.org/archives/images/news/opo23010a.jpg" border="0" align="left" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This archival image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope captures a curious linear feature that is so unusual it was first dismissed as an imaging artifact from Hubble’s cameras. But follow-up spectroscopic observations reveal it is a 200 000-light-year-long chain of young blue stars. A supermassive &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/black-hole/"&gt;black hole&lt;/a&gt; lies at the tip of the bridge at lower left. The black hole was ejected from the galaxy at upper right. It compressed gas in its wake to leave a long trail of young blue stars. Nothing like this has ever been seen before in the Universe. This unusual event happened when the Universe was approximately half its current age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This intergalactic skyrocket is likely the result of multiple collisions of supermassive black holes. Astronomers suspect the first two galaxies merged perhaps 50 million years ago. That brought together two supermassive black holes at their centers. They whirled around each other as a binary black hole. When the single black hole took off in one direction, the binary black holes shot off in the opposite direction. There is a feature seen on the opposite side of the host galaxy that might be the runaway binary black hole. Circumstantial evidence for this is that there is no sign of an active black hole remaining at the galaxy’s core. The next step is to do follow-up observations with the NASA/ESA/CSA &lt;a href="http://esawebb.org"&gt;James Webb Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt; and NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory to confirm the black hole explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results are featured in the paper published on 6 April 2023 in the &lt;em&gt;Astrophysical Journal Letters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.spacetelescope.org/archives/images/news/opo2302a.jpg" border="0" align="left" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope shows a pair of &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/quasar/"&gt;quasars&lt;/a&gt; (known as J0749+2255) that existed when the Universe was just 3 billion years old. They are embedded inside a pair of colliding galaxies. The quasars are separated by less than the size of a single galaxy. Quasars are powered by voracious, supermassive &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/black-hole/"&gt;black holes&lt;/a&gt; blasting out ferocious fountains of energy as they engorge themselves on gas, dust, and anything else within their gravitational grasp. The black holes will eventually merge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery required the combined power of the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and the W.M. Keck Observatories in Hawaii. Multi-wavelength observations from the International Gemini Observatory in Hawaii, NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in New Mexico, and NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory also contributed to understanding the dynamic duo. And, &lt;a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Gaia"&gt;ESA's Gaia space observatory&lt;/a&gt; helped identify this double quasar in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hubble shows, unequivocally, that this is indeed a genuine pair of supermassive black holes, rather than two images of the same quasar created by a foreground gravitational lens. And, Hubble shows a tidal feature from the merging of two galaxies, where gravity distorts the shape of the galaxies forming two tails of stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Hubble's sharp resolution alone isn't good enough to go looking for these dual light beacons. Researchers enlisted Gaia, which launched in 2013, to pinpoint potential double-quasar candidates. Gaia measures the positions, distances, and motions of nearby celestial objects very precisely. But in a novel technique, it can be used to explore the distant universe. Gaia's huge database can be used to search for quasars that mimic the apparent motion of nearby stars. The quasars appear as single objects in the Gaia data because they are so close together. However, Gaia can pick up a subtle, unexpected "jiggle" that mimics an apparent change in position of some of the quasars it observes. In reality, the quasars aren't moving through space in any measurable way. Instead, their jiggle could be evidence of random fluctuations of light as each member of the quasar pair varies in brightness on timescales of days to months, depending on their black hole's feeding schedule. This alternating brightness between the quasar pair is similar to seeing a railroad crossing signal from a distance. As the lights on both sides of the stationary signal alternately flash, the sign gives the illusion of "jiggling."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Hubble peers into the distant past, this double quasar no longer exists. Over the intervening 10 billion years, their host galaxies have likely settled into a giant elliptical galaxy, like the ones seen in the local universe today. And, the quasars have merged to become a gargantuan, supermassive black hole at its centre. The nearby giant elliptical galaxy, M87, has a monstrous black hole weighing 6.5 billion times the mass of our Sun. Perhaps this black hole was grown from one or more galaxy mergers over the past billions of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results are featured in the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05766-6"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published on 5 April 2023 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://cdn.spacetelescope.org/archives/images/news/potw2314a.jpg" border="0" align="left" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The somewhat amorphous spiral &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/galaxy/"&gt;galaxy&lt;/a&gt; UGC 2890 appears side-on in this image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, with bright foreground &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/star/"&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt; studding the image. This galaxy lies around 30 million light-years away in the constellation Camelopardalis. In 2009 astronomers spotted a catastrophically powerful &lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/supernova/"&gt;supernova&lt;/a&gt; explosion in UGC 2890. While the supernova itself has long since faded from view, Hubble recently took a break from its regular observing schedule to inspect the aftermath of this explosive event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Type II supernova is a spectacularly energetic explosion that marks the violent death of a massive star. As it runs out of the elements necessary to fuel nuclear fusion, the core of a massive star flickers out and stops producing energy. With nothing to support the crushing force of gravity, the core of the star shrinks and then suddenly implodes, leaving the star’s outer layers to collapse inwards and rebound out into space as a supernova explosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This observation is one of many Hubble investigations of Type II supernovae. Astronomers turned to Hubble’s&lt;a href="https://esahubble.org/about/general/instruments/acs/"&gt; Advanced Camera for Surveys&lt;/a&gt; to explore the surroundings of Type II supernovae in the hope of discovering the ages and masses of stars in the neighbourhood. This will reveal insights into the types of stars that eventually create Type II supernovae, as well as revealing any stellar survivors of colossal supernova explosions.&lt;/p&gt;
