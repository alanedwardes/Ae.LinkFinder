    <title>Drupal 10.1 is now available</title>
    <link>https://www.drupal.org/blog/drupal-10-1-0</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What&#039;s new in Drupal 10.1?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first feature release of Drupal 10 is packed with amazing improvements! It makes customizing the look of your site easier, adds support for decoupled navigation, improves content modeling and editing, block management, performance and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Customizing the look of Drupal is now easier&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating UI components with Drupal is easier and more enjoyable with the new experimental Single Directory Components module. The module bundles template, style, and JavaScript files together as components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twig template debugging and render caching settings are now exposed on an easy to use admin page. Plus the new add_class and set_attribute Twig filters were introduced to make markup manipulation easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Decoupled navigation gets dedicated support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal is widely used as a building block in fully integrated decoupled applications. To make this even easier Drupal 10.1.0 has new APIs for retrieving menus configured in Drupal using the Linkset standard. This makes it easy for developers to provide non-developers the option to manage their menus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Content editing made easier&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal 10.1 comes with various CKEditor improvements &lt;a href=&quot;https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/autoformat.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;including an autoformat feature&lt;/a&gt; that recognizes when you are typing a list or a header and automatically formats it accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;CKEditor 5 automatic formatting&quot; height=&quot;546&quot; src=&quot;/files/CKEditorFormatting.gif&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;CKEditor 5 automatic formatting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For source code examples, the available language options are now customizable in the editor configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Content modeling and management streamlined&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal 10.1 revamps the user interface to reuse existing fields to help site builders with making informed decisions when creating content models. When reusing an existing field, the field settings are now copied from the pre-existing field settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;New field reuse interaction&quot; height=&quot;1468&quot; src=&quot;/files/ReuseField.gif&quot; width=&quot;1964&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Improved field reuse experience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text fields can now enforce a specific text format, making the user interface for content editors simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulk operation forms now use a floating action bar to reduce the amount of space used when not needed, while still enabling an easy application of actions on multiple selected content items without the need to scroll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Bulk operations now use a floating action bar&quot; height=&quot;1142&quot; src=&quot;/files/BulkOperations.png&quot; width=&quot;1688&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;New floating bulk operations bar at the bottom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unified entity revision editing experience was added. This makes prior versions of content easier to manage regardless of whether they are in content blocks or nodes or other entities. This also makes it easy for developers to provide an experience that is inline with Drupal core for managing revisions in custom entity types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Block and page management made more flexible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Drupal 10.1, you can now create custom blocks directly under Structure in the administrative interface. More granular permissions allow granting block management per type and revisions to block content can be reviewed and rolled back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding administrative listings is now easier with a new option in Views to allow creating pages that use the administration theme regardless of their path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Faster real and perceived page performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BigPipe is a feature in Drupal that allows browsers to load some dynamic parts of the page after an initial page is loaded, which helps users receive information faster. From Drupal 10.1 BigPipe supports serving interface previews for delayed content, which makes the user experience much smoother with less page reflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;BigPipe with a placeholder implementation for comments&quot; height=&quot;615&quot; src=&quot;/files/bigpipe-olivero.gif&quot; width=&quot;832&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;BigPipe with a comment placeholder element reduces page reflows&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsive images can now be lazy loaded with properly set width and height values for accuracy and oEmbed content can also be configured to be lazy loaded, not holding up the initial page load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML pages and AJAX responses can now be served before dynamically processed JavaScript and CSS assets have been generated, leading to faster time to first byte on cache misses. JavaScript is minified on the fly out of the box reducing file sizes significantly, something which used to require build steps or contributed modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The request type used for making AJAX requests can be configured allowing certain dynamic requests to be cached using render and edge caching capabilities, enabling faster response times. Views AJAX pagers and filters are now utilizing this feature out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An elapsed time formatter was added that calculates the duration on the frontend and can be fully cached, significantly improving accuracy for end users as well as cache hit rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Project announcements available on your Drupal site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new experimental Announcements module was added to Drupal core. This allows site administrators to get important announcements from the Drupal project on their Drupal site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Automated accessibility testing added to core&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal Nightwatch tests now include Axe Core accessibility scans. These scans check common pages and forms to help make sure core does not regress our accessibility achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Core committer team expanded&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the release of Drupal 10.0, many changes have happened in the core committer team. While we said goodbye to product manager Angela Byron from the team, Lauri Eskola became a new product manager. Ben Mullins was promoted to full frontend framework manager and full accessibility topic maintainer. Theodore Biadala and Sally Young became full JavaScript package committers and provisional frontend framework managers. Victoria Spagnolo was promoted to full release manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drupal is now officially a Digital Public Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal 10.1 is also the first feature release since Drupal was approved as a Digital Public Good (DPG) by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalpublicgoods.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Digital Public Good Alliance (DPGA)&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of the DPGA is to promote Digital Public Goods in order to create a more equitable world and help attain the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals. DPGs represent an opportunity to enable countries to access cutting edge features, drive their own digital transformation processes, and grow their local ecosystems. As open source solutions, DPGs can be the basis for community building, knowledge sharing, and joint approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More technical information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/10.1.0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;For those updating to Drupal 10.1, further technical information is available in the release notes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>State of Drupal presentation (June 2023)</title>
    <link>https://www.drupal.org/blog/state-of-drupal-presentation-june-2023</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog has been re-posted and edited with permission from &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-june-2023&quot;&gt;Dries Buytaert&#039;s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DrupalCon North America 2023 DriesNote presentation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, approximately 1,500 Drupal enthusiasts came together in Pittsburgh for DrupalCon North America. In good tradition, I delivered &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/tag/state-of-drupal&quot;&gt;my State of Drupal keynote&lt;/a&gt;. You can watch the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/igkrPMlKuOA&quot;&gt;video of my keynote&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-june-2023.pdf&quot;&gt;download my slides&lt;/a&gt; (240.6 MB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/igkrPMlKuOA&quot; title=&quot;A YouTube video&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme of this keynote was &lt;em&gt;innovation&lt;/em&gt;. As we like to say in Drupal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/about/values-and-principles#embrace-change&quot;&gt;the drop is always moving&lt;/a&gt;. If we don&#039;t keep progressing and innovating, we risk falling behind. That is simply not an option because our mission and purpose are just too important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;0&quot;&gt;License to innovate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my keynote, I talked about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/association&quot;&gt;Drupal Association&lt;/a&gt;&#039;s goal to support and prioritize product innovation. To shed light on this important topic, I moderated a Q&amp;amp;A session with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/timdoylempa/&quot;&gt;Tim Doyle&lt;/a&gt;, the new CEO of the Drupal Association, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/baddysonja/&quot;&gt;Baddý Breidert&lt;/a&gt;, the current chair of the Drupal Association Board of Directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed the strategic goals of the Drupal Association, the three-year plan we have been working on, and the actions we&#039;re taking to help accelerate product innovation. Given that it was a brief 15-minute Q&amp;amp;A, we only scratched the surface. Stay tuned for more details in the upcoming weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Jumping S-curves by letting a 1,000 flowers bloom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also discussed the importance of Drupal &quot;jumping S-curves&quot;. The pattern of innovation and growth over time follows an S-curve, with periods of slow progress, rapid innovation, and stagnation, followed by a leap to the next curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons from S-curve jumps include the importance of having a vision and purpose, grassroots innovation, a supportive environment, and allowing time for ideas to flourish. I applied this theory to Drupal and emphasized how we are well-positioned for innovation, and have been able to jump S-curves over the years because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal has a clear vision and purpose, receives contributions from many individuals, provides a supportive environment, and allows ideas to grow and flourish over time. Additionally, we have initiatives like Project Browser and Recipes that help showcase innovative ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Pitch-burgh innovation contest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we determined the winners of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/shark-tank-meets-drupal&quot;&gt;Pitch-burgh innovation contest&lt;/a&gt;, where individuals from all over the world pitched their own innovative Drupal ideas via video submissions. The response to our contest was overwhelmingly positive, with many attendees expressing their desire to see it return and expand in future DrupalCons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We received 35 proposals for DrupalCon Pitchburgh, which exceeded expectations. Moreover, thanks to the incredible support from our sponsors, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/70000-usd-for-drupal-innovation-contest&quot;&gt;we raised $75,000 in sponsorship funds&lt;/a&gt;. I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to each and every one of our sponsors: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/association&quot;&gt;Drupal Association&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acquia.com/&quot;&gt;Acquia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.1xinternet.de/&quot;&gt;1xINTERNET&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skilld.cloud/&quot;&gt;Skilld&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.palantir.net/&quot;&gt;Palantir.net&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalpolygon.com/&quot;&gt;Digital Polygon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zoocha.com/&quot;&gt;Zoocha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://imagexmedia.com/&quot;&gt;ImageX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to express my gratitude to Lee Walker from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codejourneymen.com/&quot;&gt;Code Journeymen&lt;/a&gt; and Jonathan Daggerhart from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.daggerhartlab.com/&quot;&gt;Daggerhart Lab&lt;/a&gt; for their real-time support. When the audience vote fell short by $3,000 to fully fund the fifth winner, they stepped in, and shouted from the audience that they will provide the extra funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 35 submissions can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/association/pitchburgh-pitches&quot;&gt;be viewed on Drupal.org&lt;/a&gt;. I would like to extend a special congratulations to the five exceptional projects that were granted funding as a result of the live audience vote. I&#039;m excited to see your projects come to life over the months to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/jcCQ-1czovU&quot;&gt;​​Decoupled Layout Builders&lt;/a&gt; (PreviousNext, $20,000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/1yACutnl4Qk&quot;&gt;Using Drupal Gutenberg towards the most easy to use enterprise CMS&lt;/a&gt; (Frontkom, $22,000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/t_WU_o5X1fY&quot;&gt;JSON data and schemas FTW&lt;/a&gt; (Brad Jones, $20,000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/EdTnrPZUW98&quot;&gt;Drupal API Client&lt;/a&gt; (Brian Perry, $10,000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/nAX1xe-O6fE&quot;&gt;Contributing and Mentoring the mentor&lt;/a&gt; (AmyJune Hineline, $6,000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m really excited about these particular projects being funded because many Drupal site builders have requested enhancements for Drupal&#039;s page/layout builder (proposal 1 and 2), and more and more Drupal developers are embracing an API-first approach to website development (proposal 3 and 4). The funded projects offer an interesting blend of both. While we can&#039;t guarantee that these projects will be added to Drupal core itself, they surely deserve to be taken into consideration. We&#039;ll decide that in time through our regular process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Bonus announcement and unexpected funding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;https://automattic.com/&quot;&gt;Automattic&lt;/a&gt; is the main developer behind Gutenberg, I shared the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/1yACutnl4Qk&quot;&gt;Gutenberg proposal&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://ma.tt/&quot;&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; and CEO of Automattic. Matt was really excited about the idea of more Drupal sites using Gutenberg, and he kindly offered to provide the full €20,000 in funding through Automattic. Furthermore, he will be sending some Gutenberg experts to join the sprint without any cost to the Drupal community. Thank you, Matt!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt shared this great news after my keynote, which means we received some unexpected last-minute funding. It brings the total funding for Pitch-burgh close to $100,000!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, we are able to fully fund the next project chosen by the audience at DrupalCon: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/l6yp5-KDfLg&quot;&gt;Policy based access in core&lt;/a&gt; (Factorial, €13,000). The remaining funds will be carried over to the next innovation contest or used for other strategic initiatives of the Drupal Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always love the energy that fills the air when so many from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/&quot;&gt;Drupal community&lt;/a&gt; gather together in one place. Every time I attend DrupalCon, I go home full with ideas, enthusiasm, and energy. The creativity and passion of the Drupal community constantly inspires me. I firmly believe in our ability to drive innovation at an even faster pace in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>The evolution of Drupal&#039;s composability: from the command line to the browser</title>
    <link>https://www.drupal.org/blog/the-evolution-of-drupals-composability-from-the-command-line-to-the-browser</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog has been re-posted and edited with permission from &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/the-evolution-of-drupal-composability-from-the-command-line-to-the-browser&quot;&gt;Dries Buytaert&#039;s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discover Drupal&#039;s future: how Automatic Updates and Project Browser will empower ambitious site builders with a no-code composable platform and modern development practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot; Automatic Updates and Project Browser.&quot; height=&quot;630&quot; src=&quot;/files/evolution-drupal-composability.png&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal&#039;s modularity allows developers to combine and reuse modules, themes, and libraries to create custom solutions. This modularity is one of the key ingredients that makes Drupal a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/a-composable-digital-experience-manifesto&quot;&gt;composable platform&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/the-assembled-web&quot;&gt;original motivation&lt;/a&gt; behind Drupal&#039;s modularity was to accelerate the pace of innovation and democratize the experience of site building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post has two main goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we&#039;ll explore how Drupal&#039;s composability is evolving to empower &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/drupal-is-for-ambitious-site-builders&quot;&gt;ambitious site builders&lt;/a&gt; with modern, no-code development practices. Through exciting initiatives like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/about/core/strategic-initiatives/automatic-updates&quot;&gt;Automatic Updates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/about/core/strategic-initiatives/project-browser&quot;&gt;Project Browser&lt;/a&gt;, Drupal will simplify the task of installing, composing, and updating Drupal sites, all within the Drupal user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we&#039;ll provide a retrospective on the past 10+ years of decisions that have led to significant changes in how end-users install, extend, develop, and maintain Drupal sites. By delving into Drupal&#039;s innovation process through a timeline approach, we&#039;ll showcase key contributors, significant milestones, and pivotal shifts in thinking that have influenced Drupal&#039;s approach to composability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#039;s start!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;0&quot;&gt;2011&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal 7 was released, and introduced the &quot;Update Manager&quot;. Derek Wright (3281d Consulting), Jacob Singh (Acquia), and Joshua Rogers (Acquia) had begun developing the Update Manager feature starting in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Update Manager can be considered Drupal&#039;s first no-code update system. This feature introduced the ability for users to easily download and upload modules from Drupal.org to a Drupal site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, the Update Manager uses either the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or Secure Shell Protocol (SSH). An end user can upload a module to their Drupal site through a form, and Drupal will FTP or SSH the module to the web server&#039;s file system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, fifteen years after its development started, Drupal 10 still uses the same basic Update Manager. However, this is about to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Update Manager has several drawbacks: modules can conflict with each other, updates are applied directly to your live site, and if something goes wrong, there is no way to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Two men on stage, standing behind a laptop on a pedestal, typing Git commands as they are displayed on a large screen behind them.&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;/files/drupal-8-branch-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sam Boyer and me creating the Drupal 8 branch on stage at DrupalCon Chicago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2011, we started working on Drupal 8, and later that year, in August, we agreed to adopt components from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://symfony.com/&quot;&gt;Symfony project&lt;/a&gt;. This decision was made to help reduce the amount of code we had to build and maintain ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;2012&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Symfony project was using &lt;a href=&quot;http://getcomposer.org/&quot;&gt;Composer&lt;/a&gt;. Composer is a PHP package management system similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt;. With Composer, developers can define the dependencies required by their PHP application in a file called &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;composer.json&lt;/code&gt;. Then, Composer will automatically download and install the required components and their dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, we added Symfony components directly to Drupal Core&#039;s Git repository. Core Committers would regularly run &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;composer update&lt;/code&gt; and commit their updated code to Drupal Core&#039;s Git repository. This left the end user experience relatively unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people in the Drupal community had concerns with storing third-party dependencies in Drupal Core&#039;s Git repository. To address this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/1475510&quot;&gt;we moved the Symfony components out of Git&lt;/a&gt;, and required Drupal&#039;s end users to download and install third-party components themselves. To do so, end users need to run &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;composer install&lt;/code&gt; on the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach is still used today. Drupal Core Committers maintain &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;composer.json&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;composer.lock&lt;/code&gt; in Git to specify the components that need to be installed, and end users run &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;composer install&lt;/code&gt; to download and install the specified components on their system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, it is easy to see how embracing both Symfony components and Composer was a defining moment for Drupal. It made Drupal more powerful, more flexible, and more modular. It also helped us focus. But as will become clear in the remainder of this blog post, it also changed how end users install and manage Drupal. While it brought benefits, there were also drawbacks: it increased the maintenance, integration, and testing workload for end users. For many, it made Drupal more complex and challenging to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2135189&quot;&gt;Drupal Core would adopt semantic versioning&lt;/a&gt;. This marked a massive shift in &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/the-transformation-of-drupal-8-for-continuous-innovation&quot;&gt;Drupal&#039;s innovation model&lt;/a&gt;, moving away from long and unpredictable release cycles that broke backward compatibility between major releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand why this decision was important for Automatic Updates and Project Browser – and Drupal&#039;s composability more broadly – it&#039;s worth discussing semantic versioning some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://semver.org/&quot;&gt;Semantic versioning&lt;/a&gt; is a widely-used versioning system for software that follows a standard format. The format is &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;X.Y.Z&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; represents the major version, &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt; the minor version, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; the patch version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a new version is released, semantic versioning requires that the version number is updated in a predictable way. Specifically, you increment &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; when a release only introduces backward compatible bug fixes. If new features are added in a backward compatible manner, you increment &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;. And you increment &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; when you introduce changes that break the existing APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This versioning system makes it easy to know when an automatic update is safe. For example, if a Drupal site is running version 10.0.2 and a security update is released as version 10.0.3, it&#039;s safe to automatically update to version 10.0.3. But if a major release is made as version 11.0.0, the site owner will need to manually update, as it likely contains changes that aren&#039;t compatible with their current version. In other words, the introduction of semantic versioning laid the groundwork for safe, easy Drupal updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal 8 was released. It came with big changes on all the fronts mentioned above: a shift towards object-oriented programming, support for Composer, the introduction of Symfony components, semantic versioning, and an unwavering commitment to simplifying upgrades for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the reaction to Composer was mixed. Many Drupal contributors greatly appreciated the introduction of Composer, as it made it easier to share and utilize code with others. On the other hand, site owners often found it difficult to use Composer. Composer necessitates using the command line, something typically used by more advanced technical users. Moreover, unexpected failures during a Composer update can be complex to resolve for both developers and non-developers alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Drupal Association&#039;s engineering team, together with members of the community, launched the &quot;Composer Façade&quot;. This meant that all Drupal.org hosted projects automatically became available as packages that could be installed by Composer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some behind-the-scenes magic going on to help the Drupal community transition to Composer. For example, Drupal.org extensions were available to Composer even though they were not using semantic versioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the coming months and years, additional features would be added to Composer Façade, including solutions to help manage compatibility issues, sub-modules, and namespace collisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Drupal has users with different levels of technical sophistication and different technical environments, we supported multiple distribution methods: zip files, tarballs, and Composer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, we were living in an increasingly Composer-centric world and updates via zip files or tarballs became less and less viable. So we agreed that we had to take a difficult path by fully embracing Composer. We began a long-running effort to make Composer easier for Drupal end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the Drupal Association engineering team started building zip files and tarballs with Composer support: you could start with a zip/tar file, and then continue updating your site using Composer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, we also introduced new ways to install Drupal Core via Composer, such as using a new &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;drupal/core-recommended&lt;/code&gt; project template. This template specifies the exact dependencies used to test a particular version of Drupal Core. Drupal Core is only released when all tests pass, so using &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;drupal/core-recommended&lt;/code&gt; helps to prevent any problems caused by using different versions of the dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A timeline that shows the progression from manual updates to automatic updates, with Drush updates, Update Manager and Composer as key milestones.&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; src=&quot;/files/automatic-updates-timeline.png&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A slide from &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-september-2017&quot;&gt;my keynote at DrupalCon Vienna 2017&lt;/a&gt; where I introduced the Automatic Updates initiative. My speaker notes read: &quot;Maybe Composer can be used under the hood to develop an automatic updates feature?&quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-september-2017&quot;&gt;DrupalCon Vienna keynote&lt;/a&gt;, I declared the need for automatic updates, and made it a top priority for the Drupal community based on community surveys and interviews. This led to the formation of the Automatic Updates Initiative. The basic idea was to make updating Drupal sites easier by making Composer invisible to most users, thus empowering more people, regardless of their technical expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2017 into 2018, David Strauss (Pantheon) and Peter Wolanin (SciShield) took the lead on planning out the Automatic Updates Initiative, and presented &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmhD6lA3PRs&quot;&gt;possible architectural approaches at DrupalCon Nashville&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their approaches drew inspiration from a multitude of Open Source projects like CoreOS, Fedora Atomic/Silverblue, and systemd. Some of the ideas outlined in their presentation have since been implemented. This is the beauty of Open Source; you can stand on the shoulders of other Open Source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the Drupal Security Team and Drupal Core release managers also extended the security coverage of Drupal minor releases from six to twelve months. This enabled site owners to update Drupal on their own schedule, but also introduced &quot;security updates only&quot; branches which will make automatic updates safer. This work was implemented with help from Ted Bowman, Emilie Nouveau, xjm, and Neil Drumm, with sponsorship from Acquia and the Drupal Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that year, at the Midwest Developer Summit organized by Michael Hess (University of Michigan), the new initiative team (composed of members of the Drupal Security Team, Drupal Association staff, and other interested contributors) defined a full initiative roadmap and began development. Key contributors were Angela Byron, David Strauss, Michael Hess, Mike Baynton, Neil Drumm, Peter Wolanin, Ryan Aslett, Tim Lehnen and xjm (sponsored by Acquia, Pantheon, the Drupal Association, SciShield, and the Universities of Michigan and Minnesota).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work continued at Drupal Europe in Darmstadt, when the Automatic Updates Initiative team met with contributors from the Composer Initiative to compare needs and goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;7&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, with sponsorship from the European Commission (EC), the Drupal Association contracted additional developers to build the first iteration of the Automatic Updates concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the server-side, the funding from the EC resulted in all packages hosted on Drupal.org being signed with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/drupal/php-signify&quot;&gt;PHP Signify&lt;/a&gt;. PHP Signify is a PHP implementation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://packages.debian.org/sid/utils/signify-openbsd&quot;&gt;OpenBSD&#039;s Signify&lt;/a&gt;. PHP Signify assists in verifying the authenticity of Drupal modules, safeguarding against malicious forgeries. Additionally, Drupal extended OpenBSD&#039;s Signify to support chained signatures (CSIG) for better key rotation and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the client-side, the funding resulted in a contributed module for Drupal 7. Due to the European Commission&#039;s exclusive use of Drupal 7 at the time, a Drupal 8 module was out of scope. The Drupal 7 module updates tar-based installations of Drupal, as Composer wasn&#039;t introduced until Drupal 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-october-2019&quot;&gt;DrupalCon Amsterdam keynote&lt;/a&gt; in late 2019, I provided an update on the Automatic Updates initiative with the assistance of Tim Lehnen from the Drupal Association:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/46KwI8ufOKQ&quot; title=&quot;A YouTube video&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until 2020, contributed modules used version numbers like &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;8.x-2.1&lt;/code&gt;. This example meant the module was compatible with Drupal 8, and that it was major version 2 with patch level 1. In other words, we supported major and patch level releases, but no minor releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finally updated Drupal.org to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/node/3108648&quot;&gt;enable semantic versioning for contributed modules&lt;/a&gt;, which brought them up to date with best practices, including the ability to have minor releases, which was consistent with Drupal Core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Composer Façade continued to support modules that had not adopted semantic versioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Automativ Updates initiative requires integrity checks for Drupal core, Composer 2, package signing and a custom bootloader.&quot; height=&quot;1155&quot; src=&quot;/files/drupal-10-automated-updates.png&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A slide from &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-july-2020&quot;&gt;my keynote at DrupalCon Global 2020&lt;/a&gt; where I gave an update on the Automatic Updates initiative. The slide shows the four major architectural building blocks of the Automatic Updates initiative.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, work on Automatic Updates continued. Because we had already embraced Composer, it seemed obvious that we would use Composer under the hood to power Automatic Updates. However, there was one feature we identified as missing from the existing Composer/Packagist ecosystem: package signing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Composer&#039;s main security measure is at the transport layer: communication between the client (Drupal) and the package repository (drupal.org, packagist.org, github.com) is protected by https (TLS). However, we didn&#039;t believe that to be sufficient for an automatic update system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in 2020, at a CMS security conference sponsored by Google, David Strauss proposed that Drupal implement &lt;a href=&quot;https://theupdateframework.io/&quot;&gt;The Update Framework&lt;/a&gt; (TUF), which would resolve several architectural issues with PHP Signify and also provide a specification to mitigate numerous kinds of supply chain attacks that we had not considered previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start off this project, developers from the Drupal community met with leaders of &lt;a href=&quot;https://typo3.org/&quot;&gt;TYPO3&lt;/a&gt; (Benni Mack, Oliver Hader) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joomla.org/&quot;&gt;Joomla!&lt;/a&gt; (David Jardin, Tobias Zuluaf) to ensure this implementation of TUF would be beneficial not only to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/&quot;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, but to the broader PHP ecosystem, especially to other Composer-driven projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With guidance from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/trishankkarthik&quot;&gt;Trishank Karthik Kuppusamy&lt;/a&gt; (Datadog) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joshuagl&quot;&gt;Joshua Lock&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf&quot;&gt;Python TUF&lt;/a&gt;), Ted Bowman, Adam Globus-Hoenich, xjm, David Strauss, David Stoline, and others developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/php-tuf/php-tuf&quot;&gt;PHP-TUF&lt;/a&gt;, with sponsorship from Acquia, Pantheon, and DDEV. PHP-TUF handles the client-side part of TUF that will run as part of every Drupal site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, the Drupal Association also began working on the server-side of the TUF implementation so that Drupal.org would be able to sign packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to securing the update process with TUF, we also needed to figure out how to apply updates to a live site with minimal interruption. David Strauss, Mike Baynton, and Lucas Hedding (sponsored by Pantheon, Tag1, and MTech, respectively) had previously &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/php-rot/rot&quot;&gt;prototyped a blue-green deployment approach&lt;/a&gt; similar to the one used by CoreOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided that the required changes to support this would be too disruptive to Drupal, so we pivoted to a new approach proposed by David Strauss: to perform updates in a temporary copy of the site&#039;s codebase and then copy the changes to the live codebase as the final step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not perfectly atomic in the way that a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-green_deployment&quot;&gt;blue-green deployment&lt;/a&gt; would have been, the key advantage to this approach is that it didn&#039;t require any changes to Drupal Core&#039;s file structure, which meant that it could also be easily adopted by other PHP projects. Travis Carden (Acquia) began implementing this approach as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/php-tuf/composer-stager&quot;&gt;Composer Stager&lt;/a&gt; library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;2021&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A design proposal for Automatic Updates.&quot; height=&quot;673&quot; src=&quot;/files/automatic-updates-2021.png&quot; width=&quot;1418&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A design proposal for Automatic Updates. There are updates available for different modules. You can upgrade them immediately using the user interface, or you can let the scheduler run to do it for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second iteration of the Automatic Updates module was released as a beta. Unlike the first iteration sponsored by the European Commission, this version worked for Composer-based projects by leveraging the newly created Composer Stager library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had also gone on a virtual listening tour around the same time, and when I asked people why they fell in love with Drupal, the most common response had to do with the empowerment they felt from Drupal&#039;s no-code/low-code approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I proposed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/ideas/issues/2940733&quot;&gt;Project Browser Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. The idea was that anyone should be able to install modules, including their third party dependencies, all without having to resort to using Composer on the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dovetailed nicely with the Automatic Updates initiative. The combination of Automatic Updates and Project Browser would give Drupal the equivalent of an &#039;app store&#039;, making it easy for anyone to discover, install, and update a module and its components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;10&quot;&gt;2022&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A design proposal for the Project Browser.&quot; height=&quot;968&quot; src=&quot;/files/project-browser-2022.png&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A design proposal for the Project Browser. Users can filter modules by category, development status, security policy and more. Users can also page through results or sort the results by the number of active installs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, we began work on making Automatic Updates&#039; Composer functionality available for Project Browser, so that module installs and updates are handled in the same seamless, robust way. The new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3346707&quot;&gt;Package Manager&lt;/a&gt; (a sub-module of Automatic Updates) provides this functionality for both Automatic Updates and Project Browser, and will be the cornerstone of Drupal&#039;s install and update functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Mullins (Acquia), Narendra Singh Rathore (Acquia) and Fran Garcia-Linares (Drupal Association) from the Project Browser team collaborated with Ted Bowman (Acquia), Adam Globus-Hoenich (Acquia), Kunal Sachdev (Acquia), Omkar Podey (Acquia), and Yash Rode (Acquia) from the Automatic Updates team in order to enhance the Package Manager&#039;s capabilities in order to cater to both use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While work was ongoing on the client side of both Automatic Updates and the Project Browser, the Drupal Association remained focused on the server side. The Drupal Association put out an RFP to implement the TUF signing specification in a way that would integrate with Drupal.org&#039;s packaging pipeline. Together with Christopher Gervais and his team at Consensus Enterprises, they developed and released the Open Source &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/rugged/rugged&quot;&gt;Rugged server&lt;/a&gt;. A server-side TUF implementation that is the companion to the PHP TUF client implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal Association team member Fran Garcia-Linares also started work on new Drupal.org endpoints that will feed the necessary data for the Project Browser. These endpoints were built on modern Drupal, with JSON:API, and will be deployed to production in the first half of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;11&quot;&gt;2023&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings us to today. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/about/core/strategic-initiatives/project-browser&quot;&gt;Project Browser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/about/core/strategic-initiatives/automatic-updates&quot;&gt;Automatic Updates&lt;/a&gt; are still two of the biggest initiatives for Drupal. Chris Wells (Redfin Solutions) and Leslie Glynn (Redfin Solutions) are leading the Project Browser initiative, and Ted Bowman (Acquia) and Tim Lehnen (Drupal Association) are leading the Automatic Updates initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are built on top of Drupal&#039;s new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3346707&quot;&gt;Package Manager&lt;/a&gt;. Package Manager provides these initiatives with the ability to programmatically utilize Composer under the hood. Acquia and the Drupal Association are funding several people to work on these initiatives full-time, while other organizations like Redfin Solutions, Agileana, PreviousNext, Third &amp;amp; Grove, and more have provided extensive part-time contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing this, Narayan Newton (Tag1 Consulting), as part of the Drupal.org infrastructure team, is working on deploying the Rugged TUF server on the Drupal.org infrastructure. xjm (Agileana) and catch (Third &amp;amp; Grove), two of Drupal Core&#039;s release managers, are also collaborating on both the client and server sides of the initiative to help smooth the path to inclusion into Drupal Core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have built key parts of our solution in such a way that they can easily be adopted by any PHP project: from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/php-tuf/php-tuf&quot;&gt;PHP-TUF&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/rugged/rugged&quot;&gt;Rugged&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/php-tuf/composer-stager&quot;&gt;Composer Stager&lt;/a&gt;. In the spirit of Open Source, our implementation was based on other Open Source projects, and now our work can be leveraged by others in turn. We encourage any PHP project that seeks to implement automated updates and a UI-based package manager to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/automatic_updates&quot;&gt;Automatic Updates&lt;/a&gt; is currently available as contributed module, which facilitates updates for Drupal Core. The Automatic Updates Extensions module (a sub-module that ships with Automatic Updates) provides automatic updates for contributed modules and themes. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/project_browser&quot;&gt;Project Browser&lt;/a&gt; is also currently available as a contributed module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to have both Automatic Updates and Project Browser included in Drupal Core, making them out-of-the-box features for all end users. I&#039;m hopeful we can take the final steps to flush out the remaining bugs, finalize the Drupal.org services and APIs, and move these modules to Drupal Core in the second half of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;12&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting Automatic Updates and Project Browser into Drupal Core will be the result of 10+ years of hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all these years, we believe Drupal&#039;s Automatic Updates and Project Browser to be both the most user-friendly and most security-conscious tools of their kind among all PHP applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were also able to overcome most of the drawbacks of the original Drupal 7 Update Manager: Composer helps us manage module conflicts, and updates are first applied to a staged copy of the site&#039;s codebase to ensure they do not cause any unintended side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Drupal will offer an &#039;app-store&#039;-like experience. Drupal contributors can register, promote, update, version, and certify modules through Drupal.org. And Drupal end users can securely install and update modules from within their Drupal site without having to use the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m excited about achieving this milestone because it will make Drupal a lot easier to use. In fact, Drupal will be easier to install and update than Drupal 7 ever was. Think about that. Furthermore, Drupal will help showcase how one can democratize composability and advanced dependency management. I&#039;m optimistic that in a few years, we&#039;ll realize that adopting Composer for dependency management was the correct decision, even if it was difficult initially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of people have been involved in climbing to reach this summit, and hundreds more outside of the Drupal project have influenced and guided our thinking. I&#039;m grateful to everyone involved in helping to make Drupal more composable and easier to use for people worldwide. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to Alex Bronstein, Christopher Wells, David Strauss, Derek Wright, Gábor Hojtsy, Lee Rowlands, Nathaniel Catchpole, Neil Drumm, Ted Bowman, Tim Lehnen, Tim Plunkett, Peter Wolanin, Wim Leers, and xjm for their contributions to this blog post. Taking a stroll down memory lane with you was a blast!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With the help of the above reviewers, I made an effort to acknowledge and give credit to those who deserve it. However, there is always a possibility that we missed significant contributors.

    <title>Drupal 10.0.0 is available</title>
    <link>https://www.drupal.org/blog/drupal-10-0-0</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to 2129 contributors from 616 organizations resolving 4083 issues in the past two and a half years, Drupal 10.0.0 is available today! This new version sets Drupal up for continued stability and security for the longer term. All new features will be added to Drupal 10 going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s new in Drupal 10.0.0?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Better looking on the frontend and backend&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Olivero theme provides a modern look and feel. Olivero includes built-in support for multi-level menus and listings in responsive grids. The new administration theme, Claro, provides an accessible, clean interface for site management. The prior default themes Bartik and Seven are available as contributed projects if you wish to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshots of Olivero and Claro overlayed&quot; src=&quot;/files/OliveroClaro.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CKEditor 5 is the new content editor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With CKEditor 4 reaching end of life at the end of 2023, it was time to upgrade. Thanks to a fantastic collaboration with its developers, Drupal 10 comes with CKEditor 5 built-in. The new version brings a modern editing experience with in-place controls and support for arbitrary input and output formats. Optional premium features are also available, such as live collaborative editing. An upgrade path is provided to move editor settings over and developer tools are available to help port any custom integrations. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ckeditor.com/blog/drupal-and-ckeditor-taking-content-editing-to-the-next-level/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Read more in CKSource&#039;s very extensive blog post.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, CKEditor 4 is also available as a contributed project, so you can continue using that for Drupal 10 for now until its end of support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;CKEditor 5 feature highlights&quot; src=&quot;/files/ckeditor-5-features.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Internet Explorer support is removed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has ended support for Internet Explorer and so has Drupal. This allows Drupal themes to use modern solutions for user facing problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Responsive grids in views&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Views now supports a responsive grid display format. Instead of specifying the number of columns, and screen widths, users specify the maximum number of columns, the minimum grid cell width and the gutter spacing. When the grid cells resize to a point where they’re below the minimum width, the grid will reflow to have less columns. Alternatively, the grid will expand to fit in as many columns as permitted, while keeping the grid width above the minimum value. Dropping Internet Explorer 11 support enabled the addition of this feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Starterkit theme generation tool&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal 10 introduces a new command line tool to generate a standalone theme from a compatible base theme. We recommend using the tool to prevent breaking a sub-theme when the base theme changes. Runtime theme extension is still supported, but only advised if you have full control of the base theme (e.g. by creating it with the starterkit command).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Requires Symfony 6.2 and PHP 8.1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal 10.0 depends on the Symfony 6.2 framework, and later Drupal 10 minor versions will be updated to future minor versions of Symfony 6. This sets Drupal up with the latest version of the underlying platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As PHP 7 reached end of life on November 28, 2022, it was clear Drupal 10 must require at least PHP 8. Symfony 6.2 requires PHP 8.1 and choosing that version provides the best support timeline for Drupal 10 itself as well. PHP 8.2 is also fully supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Non-essential features removed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quick Edit, Aggregator, HAL, RDF, and Color modules have been removed from core. They are available as contributed projects. This allows Drupal 10 to focus on the core strengths of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;All features added since Drupal 9.0 are still here&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal 10.0.0 includes all of the features that were added to Drupal since 9.0, such as lazy image loading support for better frontend performance, WebP support in image styles, a dedicated Content Editor user role, &quot;Manage permissions&quot; tabs for entity bundles, and bundle classes on the PHP level for better code encapsulation, among many other improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thousands of contributed projects ready at launch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the diligent work of the Drupal community on automated code update tools, porting events and dedicated work on key projects over the past two and a half years, Drupal 10 launches with almost three thousand compatible extensions, 26% more than how many Drupal 9 launched with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The future of Drupal 10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All new features will be added to only Drupal 10 going forward. Several key improvements are already in the works as contributed projects. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/project_browser&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Project Browser contributed project is now in beta&lt;/a&gt; and includes a Composer-based user interface to install contributed projects with all their dependencies. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/automatic_updates&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Automatic Updates contributed project is already stable&lt;/a&gt;, allowing you to apply patch-level core updates to your site. (Experimental support is included for minor version updates and contributed project updates). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/distributions_recipes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Recipes initiative&lt;/a&gt; is less far along but already has early versions of automation functionality to ship composable bundles of Drupal modules and configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these are planned to be added to Drupal 10 core in the future and will help users find, keep up with and combine all the fantastic contributed projects the Drupal community is famous for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Things to consider when updating to Drupal 10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/10.0.0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Read the release notes&lt;/a&gt; for more information about platform requirements, removed modules and themes, dependency changes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does this release mean for me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Visual of support timelines of Drupal minor releases&quot; src=&quot;/files/DrupalTimelines2023.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drupal 9 site owners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal 9 will reach end-of-life alongside two of its key components (Symfony 4 and CKEditor 4 on November 1, 2023). There is a small chance that a final security release of Drupal 9 could be issued between November 1 and November 30, 2023 if one of these dependencies chooses to do so as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrades to Drupal 10 are supported from Drupal 9.4 and 9.5. However, Drupal 9.4 will no longer receive normal bugfixes. For continued bugfix support, Drupal 9 users should update to Drupal 9.5 now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal 9.4 and 9.5 will both receive security fixes until the release of 10.1 on June 21, 2023. After that date, Drupal 9.5 will be the only Drupal 9 version to receive security fixes until the November 2023 end-of-life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drupal 8 site owners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/psa-2021-11-30&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Drupal 8 is end of life as of November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;. There is no direct upgrade path to Drupal 10 from Drupal 8, so you will need to first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/docs/upgrading-drupal/how-to-prepare-your-drupal-7-or-8-site-for-drupal-9/upgrading-a-drupal-8-site&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;upgrade from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9&lt;/a&gt;. There are disclosed security issues with Drupal core that are not fixed in any Drupal 8 version, so if you have not yet upgraded to Drupal 9, do so as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drupal 7 site owners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/psa-2022-02-23&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Drupal 7 support was extended until November 1, 2023&lt;/a&gt;, and it will continue to receive bug and security fixes throughout this time. The migration path for Drupal 7 sites to Drupal 10 is stable. Choose which Drupal major version to update to based on your project timeline. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/about/9/from-7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Read more about the migration to Drupal 10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Module, theme and translation contributors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal 10 removes deprecated APIs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://drupal.org/project/upgrade_status&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Use Upgrade Status&lt;/a&gt; on Drupal 9 to check your custom modules and themes for the changes needed. Upgrade Status will also give suggestions on automating the fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translators should &lt;a href=&quot;https://localize.drupal.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;check localize.drupal.org&lt;/a&gt; for any untranslated strings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Drupal 9.5.0 is available</title>
    <link>https://www.drupal.org/blog/drupal-9-5-0</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fifth and final feature release of Drupal 9 brings a stable CKEditor 5 module, a command line theme generator and helps prepare for your update to Drupal 10. Bugfixes will be provided for Drupal 9.5 until June 2023 and security fixes will be provided until November 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s new in Drupal 9.5.0?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CKEditor 5 support is now stable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal 9.5.0 is the only feature release of Drupal that includes both a stable CKEditor 4 integration (labeled as the &quot;CKEditor&quot; module) and stable CKEditor 5 integration (exposed as a separate &quot;CKEditor 5&quot; module). CKEditor 4 has been removed from Drupal 10 and moved to a contributed project. The support overlap in Drupal 9.5.0 allows users to move to CKEditor 5 ahead of their Drupal 10 upgrade. (Sites may also install the CKEditor contributed project before upgrading to Drupal 10, but should take note that its security support will still likely end in November 2023.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Starterkit theme and theme generator are stable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Starterkit theme is used as a basis to generate new standalone themes with the theme generator command line tool, rather than being extended at runtime like the Classy core base theme. Currently, the markup provided by the Starterkit theme is the same as Classy&#039;s, but its markup will be improved in future minor releases (whereas Classy&#039;s can&#039;t).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Several themes and modules are deprecated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal 9.5 deprecates numerous themes and modules that will no longer be a part of Drupal 10 core. Altogether the Bartik, Seven, Classy, and Stable themes have been deprecated, and the Aggregator, CKEditor (4), Color, HAL, Quick Edit, and RDF modules are all deprecated. (Some of these were initially deprecated in 9.4.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is safe to use the Drupal 9 core versions of these modules and themes for as long as a site is on Drupal 9. Before upgrading to Drupal 10, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/docs/core-modules-and-themes/deprecated-and-obsolete&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;review the recommendations for deprecated modules and themes&lt;/a&gt;. Determine whether you actually need these modules or themes, or whether you can replace them with other solutions. Drupal 10 compatible versions are available as contributed projects. Drupal&#039;s Extend list, Appearance page, and Status report pages will all highlight these extensions if they are used. &lt;a href=&quot;https://drupal.org/project/upgrade_status&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Upgrade Status&lt;/a&gt; will also notify you if you are using any deprecated extensions and helps to make a choice about whether you need them going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does this release mean for me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Visual of support timelines of Drupal minor releases&quot; src=&quot;/files/DrupalTimelines2023.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drupal 9 site owners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal 9 will reach end-of-life alongside two of its key components (Symfony 4 and CKEditor 4 on November 1, 2023. (There is a small chance that a final security release of Drupal 9 could be issued between November 1 and November 30, 2023 if one of these dependencies chooses to do so as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrades to Drupal 10 are supported from Drupal 9.4 and 9.5. However, Drupal 9.4 will no longer receive normal bugfixes. For continued bugfix support, Drupal 9 users should update to Drupal 9.5 now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal 9.4 and 9.5 will both receive security fixes until the release of 10.1 on June 21, 2023. After that date, Drupal 9.5 will be the only Drupal 9 version to receive security fixes until the November 2023 end-of-life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drupal 8 site owners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/psa-2021-11-30&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Drupal 8 is end of life as of November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;. There is no direct upgrade path to Drupal 10 from Drupal 8, so you will need to first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/docs/upgrading-drupal/how-to-prepare-your-drupal-7-or-8-site-for-drupal-9/upgrading-a-drupal-8-site&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;upgrade from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9&lt;/a&gt;. There are disclosed security issues with Drupal core that are not fixed in any Drupal 8 version, so if you have not yet upgraded to Drupal 9, do so as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drupal 7 site owners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/psa-2022-02-23&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Drupal 7 support was extended until November 1, 2023&lt;/a&gt;, and it will continue to receive bug and security fixes throughout this time. The migration path for Drupal 7 sites to Drupal 10 is stable. Choose which Drupal major version to update to based on your project timeline. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/about/9/from-7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Read more about the migration to Drupal 10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Translation, module, and theme contributors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal 9.5.0 includes backward-compatible API additions for developers as well as new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since minor releases are backward-compatible, modules, themes, and translations that supported Drupal 9.4.x and earlier will be compatible with 9.5.x as well. However, the new version does include some changes to strings, user interfaces, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/about/core/policies/core-change-policies/drupal-8-and-9-backwards-compatibility-and-internal-api&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;internal APIs&lt;/a&gt; and API deprecations. This means that some small updates may be required for your translations, modules and themes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.5.0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Read the 9.5.0 release notes&lt;/a&gt; for a full list of changes that may affect your modules and themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who contributed to Drupal 9.5.0!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>State of Drupal presentation (September 2022)</title>
    <link>https://www.drupal.org/blog/state-of-drupal-presentation-september-2022</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog has been re-posted and edited with permission from &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-september-2022&quot;&gt;Dries Buytaert&#039;s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DrupalCon Europe 2022 Driesnote presentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, over 1,200 Drupalists gathered in Prague for DrupalCon Europe. It was great to see everyone together in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In good tradition, I delivered &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/tag/state-of-drupal&quot;&gt;my State of Drupal keynote&lt;/a&gt;. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Hmit4ET-l3Q&quot;&gt;watch the video of my keynote&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-september-2022.pdf&quot;&gt;download my slides&lt;/a&gt; (380 MB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Hmit4ET-l3Q&quot; title=&quot;A YouTube video&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Protect the open web&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; src=&quot;/files/protect-the-open-web_0.png&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Why the Open Web should win&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the web is ingrained in every aspect of our daily lives. We use it for work, to socialize, to pay our bills, get healthcare, and gain access to information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more transactions, collaborations and interactions are taking place online, there is now a greater responsibility to ensure that the web is inclusive of every person, and accounts for everyone&#039;s safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people are excluded from being able to access online experiences, they are also excluded from rewarding careers, independent lifestyles, and the social interactions and friendships that bring people together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those reasons, we need to do everything we can to protect and grow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/tag/open-web&quot;&gt;Open Web&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Caring for Drupal. Caring for open web&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; src=&quot;/files/caring-drupal-caring-open-web_0.png&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Caring about Drupal is caring about the Open Web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my keynote, I made the point that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/&quot;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; is an important player in the preservation and growth of the Open Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kicked off my keynote talking about some of my personal reasons for using Drupal, most of which have to do with the future of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/tag/open-web&quot;&gt;Open Web&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all these years, I continue to upload &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/photos&quot;&gt;my photos&lt;/a&gt; to my website, despite there being plenty of simpler alternatives (e.g. Facebook or Instagram). I do this for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/photos&quot;&gt;my photos&lt;/a&gt; are precious to me, and I don&#039;t want them to get lost. I look at news stories about MySpace and Facebook losing users&#039; content. I like that &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/taking-control-of-my-data-and-social-media&quot;&gt;I&#039;m in control of my own data&lt;/a&gt;, including my backups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I don&#039;t like how proprietary platforms limit my creative freedom. Pages and templates within a closed platform tend to look the same. It&#039;s hard to stand out, or even just express yourself the way you want to. With Drupal, I&#039;m unrestricted in how I share my photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, I don&#039;t like how these platforms treat my friends and family. Many of them use invasive tracking. For that reason, I don&#039;t use trackers or ads on my website. My site aspires to the privacy of a printed book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these are reasons why I want both Drupal and the Open Web to win. We don&#039;t want to live in a world where proprietary platforms reign supreme. We need more &quot;Good Software&quot;. Software that is open, flexible, secure, accessible, and pro-privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making security, privacy, accessibility, multilingual capabilities, usability, and ease of maintenance top priorities is hard work work, but it&#039;s worth it. Caring about Drupal is the same as caring about the Open Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Drupal&#039;s growth and influence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Drupal&#039;s growth and influence&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/files/ambitious-site-builders-640w_0.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Drupal has grown into a powerful platform for &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/drupal-is-for-ambitious-site-builders&quot;&gt;ambitious site builders&lt;/a&gt;. Drupal empowers millions of ambitious site builders to create Open Web experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we have to get better at promoting what we&#039;re good at to ensure more people understand how powerful and influential Drupal is. That influence becomes really clear when you look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/G4SFm4I3T0A&quot;&gt;Drupal&#039;s end users&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G4SFm4I3T0A&quot; title=&quot;A YouTube video&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Making Drupal&#039;s high bar easier to achieve&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of Drupal&#039;s impact on the digital landscape, we keep a high bar with regards to stability, reliability, accessibility, security, backwards compatibility, and more. With great impact comes great responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This high bar can make contribution difficult and slow, and is sometimes what keeps people from contributing back more to Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we can&#039;t lower the bar. However, we can make it easier to achieve our high bar. That&#039;s why we are moving from Drupal&#039;s homegrown collaboration tools to &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/&quot;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitLab streamlines and automates various steps of the contribution process. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/e6BvC-JJyHM&quot;&gt;Drupal.org GitLab video&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/association&quot;&gt;Drupal Association&lt;/a&gt; for an update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e6BvC-JJyHM&quot; title=&quot;A YouTube video&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Welcoming more people to Drupal 10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to accelerate innovation is to grow our capacity and attract more people to Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to attract new people to our community is by making &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/ockhams-razor-principle-of-content-management-systems&quot;&gt;easy-to-use software that solves real world problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-april-2022&quot;&gt;my previous DrupalCon keynote&lt;/a&gt;, I&#039;m happy to report that we&#039;ve made a lot of progress on our key initiatives. A few key highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Olivero became stable/default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CKEditor5 became stable/default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&#039;re almost PHP 8.2 ready&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We upgraded to Symfony 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/a-plan-for-drupal-11&quot;&gt;we made Drupal Core smaller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these initiatives is significant because they make Drupal and the Open Web more approachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/RnSgNo_tYxI&quot;&gt;Project Browser initiative&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/4DcrBlq6la0&quot;&gt;Automatic Updates initiative&lt;/a&gt; saw tremendous progress. Videos below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RnSgNo_tYxI&quot; title=&quot;A YouTube video&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Drupal&#039;s strategic initiatives, you can watch the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/13hyoDAFP9E&quot;&gt;Drupal Core Initiative Leads keynote&lt;/a&gt;. Highly recommended for those that want to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Upgrading to Drupal 10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal 10 is scheduled to be released in mid-December. And after the Drupal 10 release, users will have 11 months to upgrade from Drupal 9 to Drupal 10. Drupal 10 will require PHP 8.1, something to plan for as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Drupal 10 timeline&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/files/drupal-10-timeline-640w_0.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Drupal 10 will be released on December 14, 2022. This gives site owners until November 2023 to update from Drupal 9 to Drupal 10.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the upgrade path has never been easier. In the video below, we compare the upgrade path from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9 to the upgrade from Drupal 9 to Drupal 10. As you can see, the Drupal 9 to 10 upgrade is much more automated. It will be the easiest yet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0NNWnMApwfo&quot; title=&quot;A YouTube video&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update to Drupal 10 is required because some of Drupal 9&#039;s third-party dependencies will reach end-of-life. If you don&#039;t upgrade within 11 months, you will be running a site with unmaintained third-party dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Drupal 10 easiest upgrade&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/files/drupal-10-upgrade-easiest-yet-640w_0.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;We recently released the first Drupal 10 beta release. At the time we released Drupal 10 beta-1, 3 times as many modules were ready compared to when we released Drupal 9 beta-1. More than a 1,000 modules are already ready for Drupal 10!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Drupal is getting easier&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/files/drupal-getting-easier-640w_0.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Thanks to various focused initiatives, Drupal is starting to get easier. Drupal 8 was peak difficulty.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thank you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope we can all find ways to care about building the web we want to see for the future. Making Drupal better means making the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/tag/open-web&quot;&gt;Open Web&lt;/a&gt; better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d like to thank everyone that was involved in making DrupalCon Prague, Drupal 10, and the key initiatives described above a resounding success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, I&#039;d like to encourage even more people to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/community&quot;&gt;get involved&lt;/a&gt;. It might not always be easy, but it&#039;s well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Drupal 9.4.0 is available</title>
    <link>https://www.drupal.org/blog/drupal-9-4-0</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s new in Drupal 9.4.0?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth feature release of Drupal 9 brings a whole new frontend look with the Olivero theme by default and a refreshed backend interface with the Claro theme. There is also a new starterkit theme generator, better image loading performance and easier permission management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drupal now uses the Olivero frontend theme by default&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you install Drupal 9.4.0, it will look quite different from previous releases because it uses the new modern Olivero frontend theme. While the theme looks beautiful, it also has superb accessibility and adapts well to various display sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;New Olivero start screen welcoming the site owner to the Drupal community&quot; src=&quot;/files/Drupal940Olivero_0.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme is named after Rachel Olivero (1982-2019). She was the head of the organizational technology group at the National Federation of the Blind, a well-known accessibility expert, a Drupal community contributor, and a friend to many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drupal now uses the Claro backend theme by default!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Claro backend theme has been in the works for a while. It became stable and the default administration theme in Drupal 9.4.0. The new theme brings a modern look to the backend interface of Drupal. It has been available as a core experimental theme for some time, so it is well-tested with contributed projects and real-world sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Editing the new Borscht recipe in the new Claro administration theme&quot; src=&quot;/files/Drupal940Claro_0.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A delicious addition to the Umami demo in core is a new Borscht recipe (pictured), with a dedication to the fantastic Ukrainian Drupal community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New experimental Starterkit theme and theme generator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal 9.4.0 ships with a new experimental Starterkit theme and theme generator. The new Starterkit theme is used as a basis to generate new standalone themes, rather than being extended at runtime like the Classy core base theme. Currently, the markup provided by the Starterkit theme is the same as Classy&#039;s, but its markup can be improved in future minor releases (whereas Classy&#039;s can&#039;t), so once it becomes stable, Starterkit will replace Classy. For more information, read the blog post on how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/about/core/blog/new-starterkit-will-change-how-you-create-themes-in-drupal-10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;new starterkit will change theme creation in Drupal 10&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New lazy loading configuration option added to image fields&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new lazy loading configuration option is added to image fields in 9.4.0 and most image fields shipped in core are now configured to lazy load. This helps browsers to delay downloading and displaying them until they become visible, which speeds up general page display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Easier permission management for content types, vocabularies, etc.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When editing content types, vocabularies, and so on, site administrators previously had no way to control permissions in context for these entity bundles in the same interface. With Drupal 9.4.0 a new &quot;Manage permissions&quot; tab displays the permissions that depend on the given type, making them easier to configure correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Improvements to &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;drupal/core-recommended&lt;/code&gt; for security update management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/node/3285240&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;drupal/core-recommended&lt;/code&gt; metapackage now allows patch-level updates for Composer dependencies&lt;/a&gt;. This means that site owners using &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;drupal/core-recommended&lt;/code&gt; can now install most Composer dependency security updates themselves, without needing to wait for an upstream release of Drupal core that updates the affected package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does this release mean for me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drupal 8 site owners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/psa-2021-11-30&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Drupal 8 is end of life as of November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/docs/upgrading-drupal/how-to-prepare-your-drupal-7-or-8-site-for-drupal-9/upgrading-a-drupal-8-site&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Upgrade from Drupal 8 to at least Drupal 9.3.x as soon as possible&lt;/a&gt; to continue receiving security coverage. Upgrading is supported directly from 8.8.x and 8.9.x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drupal 7 site owners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/psa-2022-02-23&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Drupal 7 support was extended until November 1, 2023&lt;/a&gt;, and it will continue to receive bug and security fixes throughout this time. On the other hand, the migration path for Drupal 7 sites to Drupal 9 is stable. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/about/9/from-7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Read more about the migration to Drupal 9&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Translation, module, and theme contributors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minor releases like Drupal 9.4.0 include backwards-compatible API additions for developers as well as new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since minor releases are backwards-compatible, modules, themes, and translations that supported Drupal 9.3.x and earlier will be compatible with 9.4.x as well. However, the new version does include some changes to strings, user interfaces, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/about/core/policies/core-change-policies/drupal-8-and-9-backwards-compatibility-and-internal-api&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;internal APIs&lt;/a&gt;, and API deprecations. This means that some small updates may be required for your translations, modules, and themes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.4.0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Read the 9.4.0 release notes&lt;/a&gt; for a full list of changes that may affect your modules and themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release has further advanced the Drupal project and represents the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and contributors from various organizations. Thank you to everyone who contributed to Drupal 9.4.0!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>State of Drupal presentation (April 2022)</title>
    <link>https://www.drupal.org/blog/state-of-drupal-presentation-april-2022</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog has been re-posted and edited with permission from &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-april-2022&quot;&gt;Dries Buytaert&#039;s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DrupalCon North America 2022 Driesnote presentation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, 1,300 Drupalists gathered in Portland, Oregon for DrupalCon North America. It was the first in-person DrupalCon in more than two years. I can&#039;t tell you how amazing it was to see everyone face-to-face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In good tradition, I delivered &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/tag/state-of-drupal&quot;&gt;my State of Drupal keynote&lt;/a&gt;. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Ig676RzJbLo&quot;&gt;watch the video of my keynote&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-april-2022.pdf&quot;&gt;download my slides&lt;/a&gt; (262 MB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ig676RzJbLo&quot; title=&quot;A YouTube video&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I covered a lot of ground in this presentation, so I broke my written summary into a three-part blog series. Part 1 below is focuses on Drupal 10 updates. I&#039;ll be publishing Part 2 and Part 3 later this week, which will focus on Drupal&#039;s evolved purpose/vision and Drupal 11 proposed initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drupal stands with Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&#039;t begin my presentation without acknowledging the loss of life and destruction in Ukraine. It&#039;s impacting &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/1J-kbaYaLnQ&quot;&gt;many in the Drupal community&lt;/a&gt;, which is heartbreaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may not be aware, but Ukraine is the sixth most active country in the world in terms of Drupal contributions. If you were to look at these contributions per capita, Ukraine&#039;s contributions are even more significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1J-kbaYaLnQ&quot; title=&quot;A YouTube video&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both myself and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/association&quot;&gt;Drupal Association&lt;/a&gt; strongly condemn the Russian attacks on Ukraine. Many of us might want to know how to help. The Drupal Association has compiled a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/drupal-association-statement-of-support-for-ukraine&quot;&gt;list of organizations&lt;/a&gt; that are accepting charitable donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Updates on Drupal 10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, I gave an update on Drupal 10. We had targeted a Drupal 10 release date of June 2022, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/about/core/blog/drupal-10-will-be-released-december-14-2022&quot;&gt;we made the decision to postpone until December 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to move the date back because we have more work to do on the CKEditor 5 migration path. We&#039;re upgrading from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/&quot;&gt;CKEditor 4&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/&quot;&gt;CKEditor 5&lt;/a&gt;. CKEditor 5 is a complete rewrite, with no upgrade path or backwards compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Drupal community (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acquia.com/&quot;&gt;Acquia&lt;/a&gt; in particular) has spent thousands of hours working on an upgrade path for CKEditor to make the upgrade easy for all Drupal users. While that has gone well, we need some additional time to work through the remaining upgrade challenges. Fortunately, we are getting great support from &lt;a href=&quot;https://cksource.com/&quot;&gt;CKSource&lt;/a&gt;, the company behind CKEditor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I walked through three important facts about Drupal 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symfony 6.2&lt;/strong&gt; Drupal 10 will upgrade &lt;a href=&quot;https://symfony.com/&quot;&gt;Symfony&lt;/a&gt; – a PHP framework that Drupal relies on heavily – from Symfony 4 to Symfony 6.2. At the time of the Drupal 10 release, Symfony 6.2 will be the latest and greatest release. For planning purposes, if you use Symfony components in your custom Drupal modules, you will have to upgrade those to Symfony 6.x.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHP 8.1&lt;/strong&gt; We have changed the minimum PHP requirement from PHP 7.4 for Drupal 9 to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.php.net/releases/8.1/&quot;&gt;PHP 8.1&lt;/a&gt; for Drupal 10. This is in large part because Symfony 6.2 will require PHP 8.1. Drupal users will benefit from various improvements in the new version of PHP. It also means you might have to upgrade any custom code. Because Drupal 9.3 works with PHP 8.1, you could start that work now with Drupal 9.3. It&#039;s a good way to prepare for Drupal 10.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drupal 9 end-of-life&lt;/strong&gt; Drupal 9 end-of-life will happen in November 2023. Once Drupal 10 is released, you will have 11 months to upgrade your Drupal 9 sites to Drupal 10. The good news is, this should be the easiest upgrade in the history of Drupal. On Drupal 9&#039;s release date, 71% of deprecated API uses in contributed projects had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/rector&quot;&gt;automated conversions&lt;/a&gt;. Today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.acquia.com/drupal10/deprecation_status/projects&quot;&gt;93% of deprecated API uses for Drupal 10 across all contributed projects have automated conversions&lt;/a&gt;. And we&#039;re working on getting that even higher by the time that Drupal 10 is released.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, I provided some exciting updates on the five major Drupal 10 initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Olivero&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal&#039;s new frontend theme, named Olivero, is now stable. It&#039;s the most accessible theme we&#039;ve ever shipped. During DrupalCon, Olivero also became the default theme for Drupal 10. Everyone who installs Drupal 10 will be greeted by a new frontend theme. That is significant because we used the current default theme, Bartik, for 11 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Claro&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal&#039;s new backend theme, called Claro, also became the new default administration theme at DrupalCon. Another major milestone and reason to celebrate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Starterkit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starterkit, a new way of creating themes in Drupal, is on track to be stable by Drupal 10&#039;s new release date. Releasing Starterkit means that we can move faster with theming improvements in Drupal Core. It also means that end users won&#039;t need to worry about whether upgrading Drupal breaks any of their sites&#039; themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of sub-theming a core base theme, Starterkit generates a starter theme for you from its latest defaults. This new theme will be more of a clone or fork, and will not have a runtime dependency on a core base theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;CKEditor 5&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have made great progress on our content authoring experience. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/hQyH0CUXLwE&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; for the latest update:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hQyH0CUXLwE&quot; title=&quot;A YouTube video&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Automated updates&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated updates, the Drupal community&#039;s number one feature request, is progressing well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is to have Automatic Updates in one of the first minor versions of Drupal 10, or even in 10.0 in December if the community can help us test and finalize it in time. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/mH2THdCRuJI&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; to learn more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mH2THdCRuJI&quot; title=&quot;A YouTube video&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Parts 2 and 3 of this blog series later this week, I&#039;ll focus on our strategy and proposed initiatives for Drupal 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d like to thank everyone who made our first in-person DrupalCon in two years a reality. It was amazing to see everyone&#039;s faces again and collaborate in person. Your contributions and hard work, as always, are inspiring to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also like to thank all the people that helped with my keynote. In no particular order, they are: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/burnashburn/&quot;&gt;Ash Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/u/effulgentsia&quot;&gt;Alex Bronstein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/u/grasmash&quot;&gt;Matthew Grasmick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/u/g%C3%A1bor-hojtsy&quot;&gt;Gábor Hojtsy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/u/xjm&quot;&gt;Jess (xjm)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/u/tedbow&quot;&gt;Ted Bowman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/u/baddysonja&quot;&gt;Baddý Sonja Breidert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/u/leslieg&quot;&gt;Leslie Glynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/u/hestenet&quot;&gt;Tim Lehnen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/u/nerdstein&quot;&gt;Adam Bergstein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/u/adamgoodman&quot;&gt;Adam Goodman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/u/nod_&quot;&gt;Théodore Biadala&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/u/alexpott&quot;&gt;Alex Pott&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Drupal 9.3.0 is available</title>
    <link>https://www.drupal.org/blog/drupal-9-3-0</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s new in Drupal 9.3.0?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third feature release of Drupal 9 introduces experimental support for CKEditor 5, makes the Olivero theme stable and introduces various content editor and developer improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Olivero frontend theme is now stable!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Olivero frontend theme was added in Drupal 9.1.0 and thanks to various contributors since then is now stable. A modern and clear theme, Olivero is planned to become the new default Drupal theme later (replacing Bartik). Subtheming Olivero is currently not supported, but formal support may be included in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme is named after Rachel Olivero (1982-2019). She was the head of the organizational technology group at the National Federation of the Blind, a well-known accessibility expert, a Drupal community contributor, and a friend to many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New experimental support for CKEditor 5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new beta experimental CKEditor 5 module is included with Drupal 9.3.0. Version 5 of CKEditor is an entirely new editor with visual and architectural improvements. While building the integration, the team worked hard with CKSource to implement functionality crucial for Drupal sites, such as General HTML Support and ways to dynamically load CKEditor plugins, so the visual web based setup of the editor is still available in Drupal. Also special care was given to providing a fluid upgrade path from CKEditor 4 configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal extensions that integrate with CKEditor 4 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/docs/core-modules-and-themes/core-modules/ckeditor-5-module/upgrading-modules-extending-ckeditor-4-to-support-ckeditor-5&quot;&gt;still need to be updated for CKEditor 5&lt;/a&gt;, however the plan is to remove CKEditor 4 support in Drupal 10, so we encourage everyone to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/node/3249061&quot;&gt;try the new module on non-production environments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New Content Editor role&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new dedicated Content Editor role was added to the standard profile with content editing, media management, translation, content workflow and revision handling permissions enabled by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Various developer improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entity bundles can now declare their own class, encapsulating the required business logic. A bundle class must be a subclass of the base entity class, such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;\Drupal\node\Entity\Node&lt;/code&gt;. Encapsulating all the required logic for each bundle into its own subclass opens up many possibilities for making more clear, simple, maintainable, and testable code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each user role now depends on the modules that provide the role&#039;s permissions, which means that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/node/3193348&quot;&gt;permissions will be automatically cleaned up when a module is uninstalled&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHP 8.1.0 was recently released and Drupal 9.3.0 comes with full support for the new version. The recommended PHP version to install Drupal 9.3.0 is PHP 8, but PHP 7.3+ support is kept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.3.0&quot;&gt;Read the 9.3.0 release notes&lt;/a&gt; for more information on developer improvements and changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does this mean for me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drupal 9 site owners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update to 9.3.0 to continue receiving bug fixes and prepare for 10.0.0 (or 9.4.0). The next bug-fix release (9.3.1) is scheduled for January 5, 2022. (See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/core/release-cycle-overview#windows&quot;&gt;release schedule overview&lt;/a&gt; for more information.) As of this release, sites on Drupal 9.1 will no longer receive security coverage. (Drupal 9.2 will continue receiving security fixes until June 15, 2022.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/node/2700999&quot;&gt;Updating your site&lt;/a&gt; from 9.2.10 to 9.3.0 with &lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;update.php&lt;/code&gt; is exactly the same as updating from 9.2.9 to 9.2.10. Drupal 9.3.0 also has updates to several dependencies. Modules, themes, and translations may need updates for these and other changes in this minor release, so test the update carefully before updating your production site. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.3.0&quot;&gt;Read the 9.3.0 release notes&lt;/a&gt; for a full list of changes that may affect your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drupal 8 site owners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/psa-2021-11-30&quot;&gt;Drupal 8 is end of life as of November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;. To continue receving security coverage &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/docs/upgrading-drupal/how-to-prepare-your-drupal-7-or-8-site-for-drupal-9/upgrading-a-drupal-8-site&quot;&gt;upgrade from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9.2x at least as soon as possible&lt;/a&gt; to continue receiving security coverage. Upgrading is supported directly from 8.8.x and 8.9.x. 99% of the top 1000 most used drupal.org projects are updated for Drupal 9, so the modules and themes you rely on are most likely compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drupal 7 site owners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/psa-2020-06-24&quot;&gt;Drupal 7 is supported until November 28, 2022&lt;/a&gt;, and will continue to receive bug and security fixes throughout this time. From November 2022 until at least November 2025, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/d7es&quot;&gt;Drupal 7 Vendor Extended Support program&lt;/a&gt; will be offered by vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the migration path for Drupal 7 sites to Drupal 9 is stable. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/about/9/from-7&quot;&gt;Read more about the migration to Drupal 9&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Translation, module, and theme contributors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minor releases like Drupal 9.3.0 include backwards-compatible API additions for developers as well as new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since minor releases are backwards-compatible, modules, themes, and translations that supported Drupal 9.2.x and earlier will be compatible with 9.3.x as well. However, the new version does include some changes to strings, user interfaces, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/about/core/policies/core-change-policies/drupal-8-and-9-backwards-compatibility-and-internal-api&quot;&gt;internal APIs&lt;/a&gt; and API deprecations. This means that some small updates may be required for your translations, modules, and themes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.3.0&quot;&gt;Read the 9.3.0 release notes&lt;/a&gt; for a full list of changes that may affect your modules and themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release has further advanced the Drupal project and represents the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and contributors from various organizations. Thank you to everyone who contributed to Drupal 9.3.0!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Who sponsors Drupal development? (2020-2021 edition)</title>
    <link>https://www.drupal.org/blog/who-sponsors-drupal-development-2020-2021-edition</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog has been re-posted and edited with permission from &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/who-sponsors-drupal-development-2021&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dries Buytaert&#039;s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An in-depth analysis of how Drupal&#039;s development was sponsored between 1 July 2020 and 30 June 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, I&#039;ve examined Drupal.org&#039;s contribution data to understand how the Drupal project works. Who develops Drupal? How diverse is the Drupal community? How much of Drupal&#039;s maintenance and innovation is sponsored? Where do sponsorships come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report might be of interest even if you don&#039;t use Drupal. It provides insights into the inner workings of one of the largest Open Source projects in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year&#039;s report shows that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compared to last year, we have fewer contributions and fewer contributors. The slowdown is consistent across organizations, countries, project types, and more. I believe this is the result of COVID-19, where we are in the &lt;em&gt;Drupal Super Cycle&lt;/em&gt;, and many Drupal shops being too busy growing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite a slowdown, it&#039;s amazing to see that just in the last year, Drupal welcomed more than 7,000 individual contributors and over 1,100 corporate contributors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two-thirds of all contributions are sponsored, but volunteer contributions remain important to Drupal&#039;s success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drupal&#039;s maintenance and innovation depends mostly on smaller Drupal agencies and Acquia. We don&#039;t see many contributions from hosting companies, multi-platform digital agencies, system integrators, or end users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drupal&#039;s contributors have become more diverse, but are still not diverse enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, you can also look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/who-sponsors-drupal-development&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2016 report&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/who-sponsors-drupal-development-2017&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2017 report&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/who-sponsors-drupal-development-2018&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2018 report&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/who-sponsors-drupal-development-2019&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2019 report&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/who-sponsors-drupal-development-2020&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2020 report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What data did I analyze?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at all Drupal.org issues marked &quot;closed&quot; or &quot;fixed&quot; in the 12-month period from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. This is across issues in Drupal Core and all contributed projects, including all major versions of Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What are Drupal.org issues?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each &quot;Drupal.org issue&quot; tracks an idea, feature request, bug report, task, or more. It&#039;s similar to &quot;issues&quot; in GitHub or &quot;tickets&quot; in Jira. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/issues&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.drupal.org/project/issues&lt;/a&gt; for the list of all issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What are Drupal.org credits?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2015, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/a-method-for-giving-credit-to-organizations-that-contribute-code-to-open-source&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;I proposed some ideas for how to give credit to Drupal contributors&lt;/a&gt;. A year later, Drupal.org added the ability for contributors to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/blog/a-guide-to-issue-credits-and-the-drupal.org-marketplace&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;attribute their work&lt;/a&gt; to an organization or customer sponsor, or mark it the result of volunteer efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Example issue credit on drupal.org 2016&quot; height=&quot;135&quot; src=&quot;/files/example-issue-credit-on-drupal-org-2016_1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;632&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of an issue comment on Drupal.org. You can see that jamadar worked on this patch as a volunteer, but also as part of his day job working for TATA Consultancy Services on behalf of their customer, Pfizer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal.org&#039;s credit system is unique and groundbreaking within the Open Source community. It provides unprecedented insights into the inner workings of a large Open Source project. There are a few limitations with this approach, which I&#039;ll address at the end of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;How is the Drupal community doing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 12-month period between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021, Drupal.org&#039;s credit system received contributions from 7,420 different individuals and 1,186 different organizations. We saw a 10% decline in individual contributors, and a 2% decrease in organizational contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Contributions by individuals vs organizations 2021&quot; height=&quot;419&quot; src=&quot;/files/contributions-by-individuals-vs-organizations-2021-1280w.png&quot; width=&quot;885&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this report&#039;s time period, 23,882 issues were marked &quot;closed&quot; or &quot;fixed&quot;, a 23% decline from the 2019-2020 period. This averages out to 65 issues marked &quot;closed&quot; or &quot;fixed&quot; each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, the Drupal community worked on 3,779 different Drupal.org projects this year compared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/who-sponsors-drupal-development-2020&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;4,195 projects in the 2019-2020 period&lt;/a&gt; — a 10% year-over-year decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of my research, I reached out to some of the top contributing Drupal agencies. The main reason why they are contributing less is that they are too busy growing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We grew 33% so far in 2021. We have grown our contribution as well, but there has been a shift from code contributions to non-code contributions. We&#039;ve contributed less code because Drupal has all the features we need to deliver amazing digital experiences, and has become really stable and robust. There has been less code to contribute. — Baddý Sonja Breidert, CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.1xinternet.de/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;1xINTERNET&lt;/a&gt;, Germany&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have grown 35% in the last year — from around 65 employees to 90. — Nick Veenhof, CTO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dropsolid.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;DropSolid&lt;/a&gt;, Belgium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer investment in digital has accelerated by several years the past 12 months. We grew our Drupal practice by 35% in the past year. — Paul Johnson, Drupal Director at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ctidigital.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CTI Digital&lt;/a&gt;, UK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We grew 27% in revenue last year. We expect to continue on that growth trajectory. Our only concern is shortage of Drupal talent. — Janne Kalliola, CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.exove.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Exove&lt;/a&gt;, Finland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We grew 40% over the last year. This has been driven by an increased demand for large Drupal projects on tight deadlines. With more time pressures from clients and changing personal commitments, it’s been more difficult for people to find the time to contribute. But also, more of our contribution shifted from Drupal.org to GitHub, and doesn&#039;t use the credit system. — Stella Power, Managing Director of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annertech.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Annertech&lt;/a&gt;, Ireland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We experienced unexpected sales growth during COVID. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://drupalcommerce.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Drupal Commerce&lt;/a&gt;, we grew 95% in 2020 and 25% year to date. In addition, two of our leading contributors pursued other opportunities. As new team members get onboarded and the workload stabilizes, I&#039;m hopeful we see our overall contributions increase again in 2022. — Ryan Szrama, CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.centarro.io/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Centarro&lt;/a&gt;, United States&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s great to see so many Drupal agencies doing well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than being too busy with client work, the following secondary reasons were provided:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drupal is a stable and mature software project. Drupal has all the features we need to deliver &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/drupal-is-for-ambitious-digital-experiences&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ambitious digital experiences&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, Drupal has never been this stable and robust; we don&#039;t have many bug fixes to contribute, either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a shortage of Drupal talent; the people we hire don&#039;t know how to contribute yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COVID eliminated in-person events and code sprints. In-person events inspired our employees to contribute and collaborate. Without in-person events, it&#039;s hard to instill employees with a passion to contribute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#039;s more difficult to teach new employees how to contribute when everyone is remote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People want a vision for Drupal that they can rally behind. We have already achieved the vision: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/drupal-is-for-ambitious-digital-experiences&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Drupal is for ambitious digital experiences&lt;/a&gt;. People want to know: what is next?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tools and processes to contribute are becoming more complex; contribution has become more difficult and less desirable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are getting more efficient at managing major Drupal releases. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/rector&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Rector&lt;/a&gt; automates more and more of the upgrade work. When we work smarter, contribution drops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that COVID has accelerated a lot of digital transformation projects, but it has also slowed down contribution. Parents are busy home-schooling their children, people have Zoom-fatigue, some families may have lost income, etc. COVID added both stress and extra work to people&#039;s lives. For many, this made contribution more difficult or less possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Drupal Super Cycle&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal agencies provided many valid reasons for why contribution is down. In addition to those, I believe a &lt;em&gt;Drupal Super Cycle&lt;/em&gt; might exist. The Drupal Super Cycle is a new concept that I have not talked about before. In fact, this is just a &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt; — and only time will tell if it is valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Drupal Super Cycle is a recognition that Drupal&#039;s development cycle ebbs and flows between a &quot;busy period&quot; and &quot;quiet period&quot; depending on when the next major release takes place. There is a &quot;busy period&quot; before a major release, followed by a &quot;quiet period&quot; after each major release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major Drupal releases only happen every 2 or 3 years. When a major release is close, contributors work on making their projects compatible. This requires extra development work, such as adopting new APIs, subsystems, libraries, and more. Once projects are compatible, the work often shifts from active development to maintenance work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Drupal super cycle 2021&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; src=&quot;/files/drupal-super-cycle-2021-1280w.png&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A slide from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/blog/state-of-drupal-presentation-october-2021&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;my DrupalCon Europe 2021 keynote&lt;/a&gt; where I explain the Drupal Super Cycle theory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last major Drupal release was Drupal 9, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/drupal-9-0-0-released&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;released in June of 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Last year&#039;s report analyzed contribution activity between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020. This period includes the 11-month period leading up to the Drupal 9 release, the Drupal 9 release itself, and 1 month after the Drupal 9 release. It&#039;s the &quot;busy period&quot; of the Super Cycle because the Drupal community is getting thousands of contributed modules ready for Drupal 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year&#039;s report analyzes contribution data starting 1 month &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the Drupal 9 release. There was no major Drupal release this year, and we are still 9 to 14 months away from Drupal 10, currently targeted for the summer of 2022. We are in the &quot;quiet period&quot; of the Super Cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Drupal Super Cycle concept is valid, we should see increased activity in next year&#039;s report, assuming we remain on track for a Drupal 10 release in June of 2022. Time will tell!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;What is the community working on?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contribution credits decreased across all project types, but increased for Drupal Core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Contributions by project type 2021&quot; height=&quot;571&quot; src=&quot;/files/contributions-by-project-type-1-2021-1280w.png&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core contributions saw a 7% year-over-year increase in credits, while work on contributed projects — modules, themes and distributions — are all down compared to last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Who are Drupal&#039;s top individual contributors?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top 30 individual contributors between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A graph showing the top 30 individual contributors ranked by the quantity of their contributions.&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; src=&quot;/files/top-30-individuals-unweighted-2021-1280w.png&quot; width=&quot;488&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A graph showing the top 30 individual contributors ranked by the impact of their contributions.&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; src=&quot;/files/top-30-individuals-weighted-2021-1280w.png&quot; width=&quot;487&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the weighted ranking, I weighed each credit based on the adoption of the project the credit is attributed to. For example, each contribution credit to Drupal Core is given a weight of 10, because Drupal Core has about 1 million active installations. Credits to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/webform&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Webform module&lt;/a&gt;, which has over 450,000 installations, get a weight of 4.5. And credits to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Drupal&#039;s Commerce project&lt;/a&gt; get 0.5 points, as it is installed on around 50,000 sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weighting algorithm also makes adjustments for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/about/core/strategic-initiatives&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Drupal&#039;s strategic initiatives&lt;/a&gt;. Strategic initiatives get a weight of 10, the highest possible score, regardless of whether these are being developed in Drupal Core&#039;s Git repository or in a sandbox on Drupal.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that these weights capture the end user impact of each contribution, but also act as a proxy for the effort required to get a change committed. Getting a change accepted in Drupal Core is both more difficult and more impactful than getting a change accepted to a much smaller, contributed project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weighting is far from perfect, but so is the unweighted view. For code contributions, the weighted chart may be more accurate than a purely unweighted approach. I included both charts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how you look at the data, all of these individuals put an incredible amount of time and effort into Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s important to recognize that most of the top contributors are sponsored by an organization. We value the organizations that sponsor these remarkable individuals. Without their support, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/the-privilege-of-free-time-in-open-source&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;it could be more challenging for these individuals to contribute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;How much of the work is sponsored?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people contribute to Drupal, they can tag their contribution as a &quot;volunteer contribution&quot; or a &quot;sponsored contribution&quot;. Contributions can be marked both volunteer and sponsored at the same time (shown in jamadar&#039;s screenshot near the top of this post). This could be the case when a contributor does paid work for a customer, in addition to using unpaid time to add extra functionality or polish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those credits with attribution details, 16% were &quot;purely volunteer&quot; (7,034 credits). This is in stark contrast to the 68% that were &quot;purely sponsored&quot; (29,240 credits). Put simply, roughly two-thirds of all contributions are &quot;purely sponsored&quot;. Even so, volunteer contribution remains very important to Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A graph showing how many of the contributions are volunteered vs sponsored.&quot; height=&quot;628&quot; src=&quot;/files/contributions-by-volunteer-vs-sponsored-2021-1280w.png&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers contribute across all areas of the project. A lot of volunteer time and energy goes towards non-product related contributions such as event organization, mentoring, and more. Non-code contributions like these are very valuable, yet they are under-recognized in many Open Source communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Contributions by project type&quot; height=&quot;571&quot; src=&quot;/files/contributions-by-project-type-2-2021-1280w.png&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Who are Drupal&#039;s top organizational contributors?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the individual contributors, I&#039;ve ranked organizations by both &quot;unweighted contributions&quot; and &quot;weighted contributions&quot;. Unweighted scores are based solely on volume of contributions, while weighted scores also try to take into account both the effort and impact of each contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are an end user looking for a company to work with, these are some of the companies I&#039;d work with first. Not only do they know Drupal best, but they also &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/shop-local-to-fuel-the-open-source-dividend&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;help improve your investment in Drupal&lt;/a&gt;. If you are a Drupal developer looking for work, these are some of the companies I&#039;d apply to first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of different types of companies are active in Drupal&#039;s ecosystem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Traditional Drupal businesses&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Small-to-medium-sized professional services companies that primarily make money using Drupal. They typically employ fewer than 100 employees. Because they specialize in Drupal, many of these companies contribute frequently and are a huge part of our community. Examples are Third and Grove, OpenSense Labs, Srijan, etc.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Digital marketing agencies&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Larger full-service agencies that have marketing-led practices using a variety of tools, typically including Drupal, Adobe Experience Manager, Sitecore, WordPress, etc. Many of these larger agencies employ thousands of people. Examples are Wunderman Thompson, Possible, and Mirum.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;System integrators&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Larger companies that specialize in bringing together different technologies into one solution. Example system integrators are Accenture, TATA Consultancy Services, EPAM Systems, and CI&amp;amp;T.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hosting companies&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Examples are Acquia, Pantheon, and Platform.sh, but also Rackspace or Bluehost.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;End users&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Examples are the European Commission or Pfizer.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the sponsors in the top 30 are traditional Drupal businesses with fewer than 100 employees. With the exception of Acquia, Drupal&#039;s maintenance and innovation largely depends on these small Drupal businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The larger, multi-platform digital marketing agencies are barely contributing to Drupal. Only 1 digital marketing agency shows up in the top 30: Intracto with 410 credits. Hardly any appear in the entire list of contributing organizations. I&#039;m frustrated that we have not yet found the right way to communicate the value of contribution to these companies. We need to incentivize these firms to contribute with the same level of commitment that we see from traditional Drupal businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only system integrator in the top 30 is CI&amp;amp;T with 1,177 credits. CI&amp;amp;T is a smaller system integrator with approximately 5,200 employees. We see various system integrators outside of the top 30, including EPAM Systems (138 credits), TATA Consultancy Services (109 credits), Publicis Sapient (60 credits), Capgemini (40 credits), Globant (8 credits), Accenture (2 credits), etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various hosting companies make a lot of money with Drupal, yet only Acquia appears in the top 30 with 1,263 credits. The contribution gap between Acquia and other hosting companies remains very large. Pantheon earned 71 credits compared to 122 last year. Platform.sh earned 8 credits compared to 23 in the last period. In general, there is a persistent problem with hosting companies not contributing back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We only saw 1 end user in the top 30 this year: Thunder (815 credits). Many end users contribute though: European Commission (152 credits), Pfizer (147 credits), bio.logis (111 credits), Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson (93 credits), University of British Columbia (105 credits), Georgia Institute of Technology (75 credits), United States Department of Veterans Affairs (51 credits), NBCUniversal (45 credits), Princeton University (43 credits), Estée Lauder (38 credits), University of Texas at Austin (22 credits), and many more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A graph showing that Acquia is by far the number one contributing hosting company.&quot; height=&quot;1068&quot; src=&quot;/files/contributions-by-hosting-companies-2021-1280w.png&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A graph showing that CI&amp;amp;T is by far the number one contributing system integrator.&quot; height=&quot;1068&quot; src=&quot;/files/contributions-by-system-integrators-2021-1280w.png&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often recommend end users to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/shop-local-to-fuel-the-open-source-dividend&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mandate contributions from their partners&lt;/a&gt;. Pfizer, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/why-large-organizations-are-choosing-to-contribute-to-drupal&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; works with agencies that contribute back to Drupal&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN_zar8J2G0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;State of Georgia started doing the same&lt;/a&gt;; they made Open Source contribution a vendor selection criteria. If more end users took this stance, it could have a big impact on Drupal. We&#039;d see many more digital agencies, hosting companies, and system integrators contributing to Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we should encourage more organizations to sponsor Drupal contributions, we should also understand and respect that some organizations can give more than others — and that some might not be able to give back at all. Our goal is not to foster an environment that demands what and how others should give back. Instead, we need to help foster an environment worthy of contribution. This is clearly laid out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/about/values-and-principles&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Drupal&#039;s Values and Principles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;7&quot;&gt;How diverse is Drupal?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporting diversity and inclusion is essential to the health and success of Drupal. The people who work on Drupal should reflect the diversity of people who use the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at both the gender and geographic diversity of Drupal.org contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Gender diversity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Drupal is slowly becoming more diverse, less than 9% of the recorded contributions were made by contributors who do not identify as men. The gender imbalance in Drupal remains profound. We need to continue fostering diversity and inclusion in our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot; 67% of the contributions come from people who identify as male.&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;/files/contributions-by-gender-1-2021-1280w.png&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I wrote a post about &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/the-privilege-of-free-time-in-open-source&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the privilege of free time in Open Source&lt;/a&gt;. I made the case that Open Source is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a meritocracy. Not everyone has equal amounts of free time to contribute. For example, research shows that women still spend more than double the time as men doing unpaid domestic work, such as housework or childcare. This makes it more difficult for women to contribute to Open Source on an unpaid, volunteer basis. Organizations capable of giving back should consider financially sponsoring individuals from underrepresented groups to contribute to Open Source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A graph that shows that compared to males, female contributors do more sponsored work, and less volunteer work.&quot; height=&quot;358&quot; src=&quot;/files/contributions-by-gender-2-2021-1280w.png&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compared to men, women do more sponsored work, and less volunteer work. We believe this is because men have the privilege of more free time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free time being a privilege is just one of the reasons why Open Source projects suffer from a lack of diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gender diversity chart above shows that there is a growing number of individuals that no longer share their gender identity on Drupal.org. This is because a couple of years ago, the gender field on Drupal.org profile was deprecated in favor of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isdnetwork.org/what-is-diversity.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Big 8/Big 10 demographics field&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, over 100,000 individuals have filled out the new &quot;Big 8/Big 10&quot; demographics field. The new demographics field allows for more axes of representation, but is also somewhat non-specific within each axis. Here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A graph showing different axes of diversity in Drupal&quot; height=&quot;1068&quot; src=&quot;/files/big8-big10-2021-1280w.png&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Diversity in leadership&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal.org recently introduced the ability for contributors to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/blog/recognizing-people-who-hold-key-contributor-roles-in-the-drupal-community&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;identify what contributor roles they fulfill&lt;/a&gt;. The people who hold these key contribution roles can be thought of as the leaders of different aspects of our community, whether they are local community leaders, event organizers, project maintainers, etc. As more users begin to fill out this data, we can use it to build a picture of the key contributor roles in our community. Perhaps most importantly, we can look at the diversity of individuals who hold these key contributor roles. In next year&#039;s report we will provide a focused picture of diversity in these leadership positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Geographic diversity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw individual contributors from 6 continents and 121 countries. Consistent with the trends described above, most countries contributed less compared to a year earlier. Here are the top countries for 2020-2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot; A graph showing the top 20 contributing countries in 2021.&quot; height=&quot;1594&quot; src=&quot;/files/contributions-by-country-2021-1280w.png&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The top 20 countries from which contributions originate. The data is compiled by aggregating the countries of all individual contributors behind each issue. Note that the geographical location of contributors doesn&#039;t always correspond with the origin of their sponsorship. Wim Leers, for example, works from Belgium, but his funding comes from Acquia, which has the majority of its customers in North America. Wim&#039;s contributions count towards Belgium as that is his country of residence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe contributes more than North America. However, contribution from Europe continues to decline, while all other continents have become more active contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A graph that shows most contributions in 2021 come from Europe and North America.&quot; height=&quot;571&quot; src=&quot;/files/contributions-by-continent-2021-1280w.png&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia, South America, and Africa remain big opportunities for Drupal; their combined population accounts for 6.3 billion out of 7.5 billion people in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Limitations of the credit system&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note a few of the current limitations of Drupal.org&#039;s credit system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The credit system doesn&#039;t capture all code contributions.&lt;/strong&gt; Parts of Drupal are developed on GitHub rather than Drupal.org. Contributions on GitHub usually aren&#039;t credited on Drupal.org. For example, a lot of the work on the Automatic Updates initiative is happening on GitHub instead of Drupal.org, and companies like Acquia and Pantheon don&#039;t get credit for that work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The credit system is not used by everyone.&lt;/strong&gt; Because using the credit system is optional, many contributors don&#039;t. For example, while they could, not all event organizers and speakers capture their work in the credit system. As a result, contributions often have incomplete or no contribution credits. Where possible, we should automatically capture credits. For example, translation efforts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://localize.drupal.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://localize.drupal.org&lt;/a&gt; are not currently captured in the credit system, but could be automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The credit system doesn&#039;t accurately value complexity and quality.&lt;/strong&gt; One person might have worked several weeks for just 1 credit, while another person might receive a credit for 10 minutes of work. Each year we see a few individuals and organizations trying to game the credit system. In this post, I used a basic weighting system based on project adoption. In future, we should consider refining that by looking at issue priority, patch size, number of reviews, etc. This could help incentivize people to work on larger and more important problems and save smaller issues, such as coding standards improvements, for new contributor sprints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of these limitations, the actual number of contributions and contributors could be much higher than what we report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we have fewer contributions and fewer contributors compared to last year, it is not something to be worried about. We can attribute this to various things, such as COVID-19, agency growth, and the Drupal Super Cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data confirms that Drupal is a vibrant community full of contributors who are constantly evolving and improving the software. It&#039;s amazing to see that just in the last year, Drupal welcomed more than 7,000 individual contributors and over 1,100 corporate contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To grow and sustain Drupal, we should &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/shop-local-to-fuel-the-open-source-dividend&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;support those that contribute to Drupal&lt;/a&gt; and find ways to get those that are not contributing involved in our community. We are working on several new ways to make it easier for new contributors to get started with Drupal, which I covered in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-october-2021&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;latest DrupalCon keynote&lt;/a&gt;. Improving diversity within Drupal is critical, and we should welcome any suggestions that encourage participation from a broader range of individuals and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/u/hestenet&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tim Lehnen&lt;/a&gt;, CTO at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/association&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Drupal Association&lt;/a&gt;, for supporting me during my research.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
