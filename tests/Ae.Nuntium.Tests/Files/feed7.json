That means you can grow at your own pace, striking the right balance for you as your project or audience grows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit like choosing the right gear for a bike ride—you can start in a lower gear, then shift up as you build momentum.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how that looks:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>WordPress.com Plan</strong></td><td><strong>Payment Fees</strong></td></tr><tr><td>WordPress.com Commerce</td><td>0%*</td></tr><tr><td>WordPress.com Business</td><td>2%*</td></tr><tr><td>WordPress.com Premium</td><td>4%*</td></tr><tr><td>WordPress.com Personal</td><td>8%*</td></tr><tr><td>WordPress.com Free</td><td>10%*</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>*Depending on your region, you’ll also pay a standard Stripe fee for each payment made to your Stripe account. You can read a little more about that, <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/blocks/payments/#related-fees\">here</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">For the creators, the coders, the artists, and makers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordPress.com, we believe that anyone should be able to create, share, and profit from their passions, vision, and work, whatever budget they’re playing with. It&#8217;s not just about making a living—it&#8217;s about taking risks, trying things out, and making a difference. And when you build on WordPress.com you’re building on a platform that’s been here for 17 years and counting, sending out 20 million+ emails a day and serving lightning-fast sites across the planet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re an author, an influencer, an artist, or a photographer, the power to get paid for the work you made is here, and here for good. We’d love to hear what you’re working on.</p>\n\n\t\t\t",

At WordPress.com, you’ll benefit from our lightning-fast DNS performance so that your domain loads nearly instantaneously when someone types your URL and hits “Enter.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Unimpeachable security. </strong>All domains hosted at WordPress.com get a free SSL certificate, ensuring secure and encrypted connections for your customers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Privacy protection.</strong> To sweeten the pot even more, we offer free privacy protection to keep your contact information confidential. (There are a handful of domain extensions that don’t qualify for privacy protection, so you may need to check if yours is eligible; <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/support/domains/domain-registrations-and-privacy/#privacy-protection\">learn more here</a>.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>One convenient dashboard for all your website management. </strong>Whether or not you plan to use your domain as the primary URL for a website, housing it with us is especially handy if you’re already a WordPress.com customer.

    "Title": "Reblogging Gets a Refresh",
    "Author": "Dave Martin",
    "TextSummary": "With our new reblogging interface, we've created a more respectful and gratifying experience for everyone. ",
    "RawContent": "\n\t\t\t\t\n<p>Reblogging is a way to show appreciation for another creator’s work while also providing your own audience with a valuable piece of news, work of art, or thought-provoking opinion. We recently made a few significant improvements to the experience of reblogging to make it more customizable for you while also ensuring the original creator gets the credit they deserve.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s new with reblogging</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Freedom to choose your title&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll now find the title field empty when you’re taken to the editor to reblog a piece of content. Rather than automatically using the original post’s title, you’re free to add your own flair. This allows you more creative freedom <em>and</em> reassures your audience (and the original creator) that you’re not simply passing off another person’s work as your own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. No more default featured image</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve also changed the automatic import of the featured image. This helps avoid the appearance of content duplication while also helping you manage your site’s media storage limits more effectively. That doesn’t mean you’re stuck with text only, though — you can still add your own featured image to the reblogged post.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. A new way to embed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, we’ve replaced the Quote Block with the core Embed Block for the post you’re reblogging. This change provides a more accurate representation of the original content and makes for a nice visual experience for your readers. Here’s what it looks like:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/reblog-embed.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"52154\" data-permalink=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/06/08/reblogging-gets-a-refresh/reblog-embed/\" data-orig-file=\"https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/reblog-embed.png\" data-orig-size=\"2824,1420\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"reblog-embed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/reblog-embed.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/reblog-embed.png?w=720\" src=\"https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/reblog-embed.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-52154\" width=\"611\" height=\"307\" srcset=\"https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/reblog-embed.png?w=1024 1024w, https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/reblog-embed.png?w=611 611w, https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/reblog-embed.png?w=1222 1222w, https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/reblog-embed.png?w=150 150w, https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/reblog-embed.png?w=300 300w, https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/reblog-embed.png?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px\"></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How do I reblog a post from the WordPress.com Reader?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reblogging a post within the WordPress.com Reader is a simple process.

You can still put out free posts to grow your readership, enable one-time tips and donations, or keep some of your content exclusive to subscribers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Take more creative control </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re all about giving writers and creators the power and flexibility to do things their own way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From selecting beautiful visual themes, customizing them to make everything feel more like you, or turning your newsletter into a full-fledged website or store, you&#8217;ll save time, cut costs, and have a bunch fewer logins and browser tabs to navigate by keeping everything under one roof.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, as your newsletter flourishes, you can tap into a universe of plugins, themes, and design patterns with affordable upgrades, whenever the time&#8217;s right. That means you can scale smoothly from a free newsletter to one that starts helping you earn, without feeling penned in by a rigid plan or restricted features.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/manage-anywhere403x-4.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"52140\" data-permalink=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/06/01/newsletters-paid-subscriptions/manage-anywhere403x-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/manage-anywhere403x-4.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2520,1398\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"manage-anywhere403x-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/manage-anywhere403x-4.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/manage-anywhere403x-4.jpg?w=720\" src=\"https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/manage-anywhere403x-4.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-52140\" srcset=\"https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/manage-anywhere403x-4.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/manage-anywhere403x-4.jpg?w=2048 2048w, https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/manage-anywhere403x-4.jpg?w=150 150w, https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/manage-anywhere403x-4.jpg?w=300 300w, https://en-blog.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/manage-anywhere403x-4.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kickstart your newsletter</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re thinking of starting up a paid newsletter from scratch or ready to take your existing one up a notch, there&#8217;s no better time than now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wordpress.com/newsletter\">Signing up for Newsletter</a> is the quickest route to writing, publishing, and expanding your audience from scratch.
