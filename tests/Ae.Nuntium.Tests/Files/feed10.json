The nebula is in the Perseus molecular cloud, and is located approximately 960 light-years away.\n \nHubble’s colourful view, showcasing its unique capability to obtain images in light from ultraviolet to near-infrared, unveils an effervescent cauldron of glowing gases and pitch-black dust stirred up and blown around by several hundred newly forming stars embedded within the dark cloud. Even then, Hubble just scratches the surface; most of the star-birthing firestorm is hidden behind clouds of fine dust — essentially soot — that are thicker toward the bottom of the image. The black areas of the image are not empty space, but are filled with obscuring dust.\n \nTo capture this image, Hubble peered through a veil of dust on the edge of a giant cloud of cold molecular hydrogen — the raw material for fabricating new stars and planets under the relentless pull of gravity.

The galaxy lies almost 600 million light-years away in the constellation Sextans. This image was captured by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, and it is the third of a series of [Pictures of the Week](https://esahubble.org/images/potw/) featuring jellyfish galaxies. This series of images is possible thanks to a survey in which observations were made of six of these fascinating galaxies, including JO204. This survey was performed with the intention of better understanding [star](https://esahubble.org/wordbank/star/) formation under extreme conditions.\n \nGiven the dreamy appearance of this image, it would be understandable to wonder why jellyfish galaxies should be such a crucible for star formation. The answer is that — as is often the case with astronomy — first appearances can be deceiving. Whilst the delicate ribbons of gas beneath JO204 may look like floating jellyfish tentacles, they are in fact the outcome of an intense astronomical process known as ram pressure stripping.\n \nRam pressure is a particular type of pressure exerted on a body when it moves relative to a fluid. An intuitive example is the sensation of pressure you experience when you are standing in an intense gust of wind — the wind is a moving fluid, and your body feels pressure from it. An extension of this analogy is that your body will remain whole and coherent, but the more loosely bound things — like your hair and your clothes — will flap in the wind. The same is true for jellyfish galaxies. They experience ram pressure because of their movement against the intergalactic medium that fills the spaces between galaxies in a galaxy cluster. The galaxies experience intense pressure from that movement, and as a result their more loosely bound gas is stripped away. This gas is mostly the colder and denser gas in the galaxy — gas which, when stirred and compressed by the ram pressure, collapses and forms new stars in the jellyfish’s beautiful tendrils.\n \n[*Image Description:* A spiral galaxy in the centre is tilted almost edge-on.

There is a feature seen on the opposite side of the host galaxy that might be the runaway binary black hole. Circumstantial evidence for this is that there is no sign of an active black hole remaining at the galaxy’s core. The next step is to do follow-up observations with the NASA/ESA/CSA <a href=\"http://esawebb.org/\">James Webb Space Telescope</a> and NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory to confirm the black hole explanation.</p>\n<p>These results are featured in the paper published on 6 April 2023 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>\n<p>[<em>Image description: This image shows a wide field of galaxies and stars against a black background. A callout box is used to highlight a specific linear feature that appears as a streak of small blue stars.</em>]</p>",

    "Title": "Hubble unexpectedly finds double quasar in distant Universe",

    "TextSummary": "![](https://cdn.spacetelescope.org/archives/images/news/opo2302a.jpg)\nThis image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope shows a pair of [quasars](https://esahubble.org/wordbank/quasar/) (known as J0749+2255) that existed when the Universe was just 3 billion years old. They are embedded inside a pair of colliding galaxies. The quasars are separated by less than the size of a single galaxy. Quasars are powered by voracious, supermassive [black holes](https://esahubble.org/wordbank/black-hole/) blasting out ferocious fountains of energy as they engorge themselves on gas, dust, and anything else within their gravitational grasp. The black holes will eventually merge.\n \nThis discovery required the combined power of the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and the W.M. Keck Observatories in Hawaii. Multi-wavelength observations from the International Gemini Observatory in Hawaii, NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in New Mexico, and NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory also contributed to understanding the dynamic duo. And, [ESA's Gaia space observatory](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Gaia) helped identify this double quasar in the first place.\n \nHubble shows, unequivocally, that this is indeed a genuine pair of supermassive black holes, rather than two images of the same quasar created by a foreground gravitational lens. And, Hubble shows a tidal feature from the merging of two galaxies, where gravity distorts the shape of the galaxies forming two tails of stars.\n \nHowever, Hubble's sharp resolution alone isn't good enough to go looking for these dual light beacons. Researchers enlisted Gaia, which launched in 2013, to pinpoint potential double-quasar candidates. Gaia measures the positions, distances, and motions of nearby celestial objects very precisely. But in a novel technique, it can be used to explore the distant universe. Gaia's huge database can be used to search for quasars that mimic the apparent motion of nearby stars. The quasars appear as single objects in the Gaia data because they are so close together. However, Gaia can pick up a subtle, unexpected \"jiggle\" that mimics an apparent change in position of some of the quasars it observes. In reality, the quasars aren't moving through space in any measurable way. Instead, their jiggle could be evidence of random fluctuations of light as each member of the quasar pair varies in brightness on timescales of days to months, depending on their black hole's feeding schedule. This alternating brightness between the quasar pair is similar to seeing a railroad crossing signal from a distance. As the lights on both sides of the stationary signal alternately flash, the sign gives the illusion of \"jiggling.\"\n \nBecause Hubble peers into the distant past, this double quasar no longer exists. Over the intervening 10 billion years, their host galaxies have likely settled into a giant elliptical galaxy, like the ones seen in the local universe today. And, the quasars have merged to become a gargantuan, supermassive black hole at its centre. The nearby giant elliptical galaxy, M87, has a monstrous black hole weighing 6.5 billion times the mass of our Sun. Perhaps this black hole was grown from one or more galaxy mergers over the past billions of years.\n \nThese results are featured in the [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05766-6) published on 5 April 2023 in the journal *Nature.*\n \n[*Image description:* A close-up image of a dual quasar system is shown.
