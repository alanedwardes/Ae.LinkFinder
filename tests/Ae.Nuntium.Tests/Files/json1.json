The first installment is called Estranged: Act I and is also available on steam - for free! My recommendation is to do the same, as they are directly linked. \n\nI wholeheartedly enjoyed this game due to the beautiful, fitting and diverse environments, the great slow-burn story telling and great production quality. This game is very much story based and not an arcade shooter, you will find yourself immersed but not jumping from massive action to massive action. Its suspenseful and sometimes scary, but not a horror game (which I am very thankful for). It can be poetic at times, in a calm non cringe worthy manner. The game isn't very long, but I think the length fits very well to the amount of story told and it easily justifies the very low price.\n\n\nThis is clearly a labor of love! Buy it! I can't wait for the next installment.","timestamp_created":1679482924,"timestamp_updated":1679483042,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"hidden_in_steam_china":true,"steam_china_location":""},{"recommendationid":"134345749","author":{"steamid":"76561197973524569","num_games_owned":0,"num_reviews":24,"playtime_forever":363,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":322,"last_played":1678366392},"language":"english","review":"Beautiful well-crafted indie game with great atmosphere and music, pretty good voice-acting, deep immersion.

Also if u buy it now (27.11.2022 on sale) you only pay 1,24€. or the normal price 4,99€.
