    "TextSummary": "I bought this game after playing through the first Estranged, a HL2 Mod. The first installment is called Estranged: Act I and is also available on steam - for free! My recommendation is to do the same, as they are directly linked. \n\nI wholeheartedly enjoyed this game due to the beautiful, fitting and diverse environments, the great slow-burn story telling and great production quality. This game is very much story based and not an arcade shooter, you will find yourself immersed but not jumping from massive action to massive action. Its suspenseful and sometimes scary, but not a horror game (which I am very thankful for). It can be poetic at times, in a calm non cringe worthy manner. The game isn't very long, but I think the length fits very well to the amount of story told and it easily justifies the very low price.\n\n\nThis is clearly a labor of love! Buy it! I can't wait for the next installment.",

It packs in a great deal of atmosphere which sets the tone wonderfully, and makes spending time as you try to figure out the puzzles more enjoyable\n\nIn the game you play as a fisherman who has found himself stranded on an island shrouded in mystery. As you explore the island, with nothing but a flashlight in hand, you’ll uncover the secrets of the Arque Corporation.\n\nEstranged: The Departure‘s beautiful visuals and intriguing story make it well worth a playthrough for those that crave a new adventure.",

    "TextSummary": "This game is a 10/10. Even tough the ending is kinda sad (if i saw it correctly whats happening there). This game has more realism in the topic; grafic, voice acting, ambiance than most other games. its also really, really great. I finished this game now in 2 hours without wanting to achieve  every achievment but still. I think you NEED and SHOULD buy this, you dont even have to play the first part if u dont want to. Also if u buy it now (27.11.2022 on sale) you only pay 1,24€. or the normal price 4,99€. I have so much hope for the third part and I hope it soon comes into the Shop to buy (rn its in early access and I only want to play the full version so I dont get spoilerd). Also, i have never seen that the Game says thank you (your account name) it's such a great thing for me If someone says thank you.. IDK why. Did i mention how much I like this game? ye, buy it",
