    "RawContent": "<p>Hello Jekyllers!</p>\n\n<p>Jekyll 4.2.2 has been released. Unlike prior releases, this is a simple maintenance release and may be skipped.</p>\n\n<p>For those who are still curious about the current release, here is some technical context: The previous <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">jekyll-4.2.1</code> package was built and\npublished using a Windows system. A side-effect of that action was that every file bundled into the gem ended up with Windows-style CRLF\nline-endings instead of Unix-style LF line-endings.</p>\n\n<p>For our end-users, this difference holds no significance. However, a third-party entity vendoring the release faced a roadblock. The executable\nprogram <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">jekyll</code> apparently misplaced the executable bit because of the change in line-endings.</p>\n\n<p>To that end, the Jekyll team decided to use the GitHub Actions service to build and publish releases. In-house plugins have already published\nreleases via this route serving as trials. Henceforth, and unless explicitly reported, all Jekyll releases will be built on GitHub Actions’\nUbuntu platform and published to Rubygems by @jekyllbot irrespective of the maintainer overseeing the release.</p>\n\n<p>That is all for now.\nHappy Jekyllin’!!</p>\n\n<p><em>P.S.: Jekyll 4.3.0 will be bringing you some new features very soon.. Also, our sass-converter plugin has been <a href=\"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sass-converter/tree/v2.2.0#sass-embedded\">enhanced</a> to support\nmodern improvements to Sass.</em></p>",

While the intent behind the change was to avoid forcing users to\ngenerate a <em>production build</em> separately by invoking <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">jekyll build</code>, it however had an\nunforeseen consequence — absolute URLs for assets now pointed to\nresources that were at times not yet been deployed to the configured <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">site.url</code>. That\nbroke the users’ local development workflow.</p>\n\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">v4.2.0</code> also added a series of optimizations surrounding the generation of Liquid\nrepresentation for a site’s standalone pages and layouts. However, that prevented\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">{{ page.content }}</code> and other mutable attributes from reflecting\nthe latest state of the requested attribute, thereby breaking the render of all resources\nthat were dependent on such mutable attributes.</p>\n\n<p>The last fix included in this release addresses the issue where incremental regeneration\nignored changes to documents in collections when the site is configured to use a custom\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">collections_dir</code> for all collections.</p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to @benik for helping us understand the regression caused by the decision\nto stop overriding <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">site.url</code> and proposing to revert the change.
